SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4571687991393144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5625382918255308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6888739792759857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37336890970155934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31625876505448236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37336890970155934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34809726810584335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37336890970155934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37336890970155934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34809726810584335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31625876505448236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34637560427686714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5919053929198768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42346186655538154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5919053929198768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24809385173302922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19237656498760633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19237656498760633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3038111384784521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3038111384784521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43470606390577643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28324754572898914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3038111384784521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3038111384784521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24809385173302922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3038111384784521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2686574444824922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26187076964066724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4474989545582776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4474989545582776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3957192818614867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4474989545582776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4172097877310399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6762995111918819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5348668231581951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5064942770123684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5115289917529975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6655490758730932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5434910470289585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34301143160867786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28550037057099836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5050362873794128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36573724090096055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3961636829238378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5050362873794128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4439276096326075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4439276096326075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4439276096326075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36251373506571294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39256117381481914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3510902290287717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3393255139869234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5358806085647421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3618071172463453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5358806085647421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4238133459389441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4900370502695614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6375859652310155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.594430674093743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36865221740118154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36865221740118154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2637417363616021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23695218987739625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3259958246620708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3259958246620708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34369982723276754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36865221740118154,0.36865221740118154,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46809067386434877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41392835317459215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46809067386434877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46809067386434877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41392835317459215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5797670248624216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49108642561819354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4734409509351112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44559845762006445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40018925274899747,0.40018925274899747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6030156990671541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.562200311852412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3238117980227425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.439097025270788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.416479106237286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38460093980187954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4709751917061945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39893528526346145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5665482521360805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8240285662533503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2374325855269962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21384144386582354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40573766192841776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3782751268653492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24031518844368183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3038650780228296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3782751268653492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3313276130858982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2902734621228258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3208868418207598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47397047462061437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5083804314316558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5083804314316558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5083804314316558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.603702732515548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38227123118861545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5338488712329682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45212509247119514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2579770048233563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31782699283671817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375220328735325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375220328735325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31782699283671817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375220328735325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375220328735325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3318039461646095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24117386084673206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22844774851644606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24887146219143222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25504875170744934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2822389204696264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39649942624629764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28713700341534343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42528503392293326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42528503392293326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27335308280665405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25504875170744934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4282314243883988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.271160862818178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.271160862818178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4282314243883988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39924638895570336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37868117903598386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4282314243883988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23719336857416548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4415661369194749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29812941263228915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4415661369194749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3740246108430821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36058534342050313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4415661369194749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34433800596479286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.389394464073305,0.0,0.2584202697262419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34433800596479286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.389394464073305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2992815478562807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.389394464073305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.389394464073305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4716828927224132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43975682522729315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4716828927224132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3730411248174406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4716828927224132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4198823432862315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4198823432862315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47482374064309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28475773345465794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3396991308115165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47482374064309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.381545723163141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.381545723163141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35572063029222034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.381545723163141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.381545723163141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.381545723163141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.381545723163141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2447416421180627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4643669620553603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27848667260617077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4643669620553603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4643669620553603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4643669620553603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4158742818312452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4158742818312452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4158742818312452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4158742818312452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36775386953331995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4158742818312452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39370663936176176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42228949247619335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39370663936176176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42228949247619335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42228949247619335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39370663936176176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5594877110358365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5437185293008738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.625574665483486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6637758067150217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43181851064994975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43181851064994975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43181851064994975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35713432765261144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4216257990815964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39308786835133197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4216257990815964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3334523358132747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2710010999132842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4216257990815964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31804972149875005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5235804529591971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5235804529591971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5920906967793461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33796795385478995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39899835320956706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39899835320956706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3528306383460916,0.0,0.39899835320956706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39899835320956706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3528306383460916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30214288176331744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3476301100687907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23575738253013637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39311733837426394,0.3665090155538202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3665090155538202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39311733837426394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39311733837426394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5821692985127684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2910846492563842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2910846492563842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23996450573116526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2910846492563842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2549582967383261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44673383423666446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2910846492563842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30649941119898416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5370433475115833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3179228581779773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3753335054813921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3753335054813921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30649941119898416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3753335054813921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3337989346079914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40876399651885087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.381096622645879,0.40876399651885087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3614663084809632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40876399651885087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3337989346079914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36169622251327155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2714473388406603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2422616571861828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29913231080601665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4090239946887967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4090239946887967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3813390227234404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4090239946887967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32561243706278103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32561243706278103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34329561882986653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3682186637237724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3682186637237724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26929006902247765,0.0,0.0,0.29121409025772776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32561243706278103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3682186637237724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37007492093171496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34502623443871056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32725390853840114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19504562394932468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2844328961450874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37007492093171496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37007492093171496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37007492093171496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32725390853840114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44711580402304596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3165619439808372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3776396725513947,0.0,0.5278561693923706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5278561693923706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42292474684118725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.499296680636501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4415235429819743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35720759918107314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.499296680636501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.423913471364665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4546893213856028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.423913471364665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3851404857994549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32529453361951505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.423913471364665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4225063025641301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45317999301976797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45317999301976797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45317999301976797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45317999301976797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25298995923133566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47097353374053685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3369446098676597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24822359353821571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47097353374053685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3527215316827172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4390954795252772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44200931276912364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3743999989465638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44200931276912364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44200931276912364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44200931276912364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2798851737593138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36033639184066085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46957890446096573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3772085984725547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5036700360547884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5036700360547884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4995931199099125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3951145616636278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4995931199099125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3574196782219819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4657779362082468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24067034689964933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27293824008539136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3834334946238507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26042103350652557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41127052392504154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3483629852946493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24664407485394507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3636828080169744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41127052392504154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3626933252894166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38902463140896243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3626933252894166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3626933252894166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38902463140896243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38902463140896243,0.0,0.0,0.38902463140896243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5736394919641975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7024683034764692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42127902377159543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4564315778025509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3029092150244452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27372772346251306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4564315778025509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4564315778025509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4564315778025509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43931920757961157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.518651660189387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.518651660189387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.518651660189387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42176022372899163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35622402820726473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4979218674367852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40660574386167975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39379281370106967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35622402820726473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.465866134551229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43433377693374337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43433377693374337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43433377693374337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.465866134551229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35943708776262806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4103675775983994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4401600042956856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4401600042956856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3481105328081995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4401600042956856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5532167409643812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.622818171727108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5532167409643812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31950779655146705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2807921185805329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.532768277379746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31555441111088545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3896304569075429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.532768277379746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3477108983788462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30455669385004325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37295448977664697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3159077343975069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.329800285247844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2397174868502507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37295448977664697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2236654701525652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26681967468136814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3477108983788462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35802519640633595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33379210090556466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35802519640633595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21471218627410607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22670550463885983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23760216531146838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29236535052259793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31659844602336923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35802519640633595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2301216439651729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33379210090556466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4462487037956007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3779909368521553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3779909368521553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41604416075025313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3779909368521553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4462487037956007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.351250450271281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5596085657028427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5307830886417866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5307830886417866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7003785883561446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4501701940765162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5539103080259169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29502722230247513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5492313365306125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4485053393854538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3293808989434861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5492313365306125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.4508678950297831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4508678950297831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3986984054782876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3565791113076549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3225606028986669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4508678950297831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22672272848347183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2499908855035792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4220736859976182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4220736859976182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27128898041571803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31609945430620795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4220736859976182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4220736859976182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5083804314316558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47397047462061437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5083804314316558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5083804314316558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23793313958052428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24936945952744174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37575646504743726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3182811222608982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2536971131864823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37575646504743726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37575646504743726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3068448023139808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37575646504743726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23793313958052428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5297058216699307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5297058216699307,0.0,0.0,0.4684140716171789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4684140716171789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5598738419309953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6441621399757833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5211491327280955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29906917914994735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4715951125410278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3297621258469209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5567559620353743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5190716858055121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36574467394804844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28360519031463916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3793762332203832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3793762332203832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44788415758145766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30239511063643454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3542193548037482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28360519031463916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5007238622516167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5902746944779335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6331282641225287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27845302076758266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3430533907371289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23700215590922566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35813971549674756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40500212048472195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35813971549674756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40500212048472195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40500212048472195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33873918193094976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3830630366783227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3830630366783227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3830630366783227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3830630366783227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3029540996360919,0.33873918193094976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3029540996360919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3670815317014444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23279030983915355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3670815317014444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4333692735419861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4040364804920694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25668117211982583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4040364804920694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3100417122009238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37195267203505317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5620667188863473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37646844586996075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6356128716054896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2024029634957366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3076963851905383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22597124951642816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3191644442256338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3767992976748016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3767992976748016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3767992976748016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33320021413003537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35129546873530454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22597124951642816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.518651660189387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43931920757961157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.518651660189387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.518651660189387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42423492689914827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7363123786577519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39488409592403756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3491924378054217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28498133533420555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41959509889982755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36751938657205985,0.0,0.45005743780991403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45005743780991403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45005743780991403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3663396903055003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5785428094566918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.539383880717674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4900494650081463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42361298941351977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7493508013009597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5089453917560813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5069486169098679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3210054576496554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4294062503976161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34227328764037873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37074771457244404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4482900810846958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4256131779755871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39680535972202624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39680535972202624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4256131779755871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4256131779755871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3763658873919241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3255899879597509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23293408994474857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3035522840452786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20616717277630509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3035522840452786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3255899879597509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3255899879597509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3255899879597509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3255899879597509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2879162842825003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3255899879597509
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6636989513044007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42026149889456066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6187761910289826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5366897409626883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3551592302073969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31987084848212155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35947111954057887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45453107018972405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3843054825053194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30523555177194595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5682354623007897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5024854846685788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3407779107552241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4640242133304806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3633443350422298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40043556640101224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4180453646515027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4727463942607756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38604731357924044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40043556640101224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.412021886267567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44193441472837286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3495138655851781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3495138655851781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44193441472837286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44193441472837286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40932996141793804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40932996141793804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32372789343176317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40932996141793804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3619667861270991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3065554232066519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40932996141793804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3306109630058266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2987607565786031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35640390903203556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4981733007739374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4981733007739374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42197319806786965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3056198515282693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24998534487465146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4271884969819267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4271884969819267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4271884969819267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4271884969819267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3378517217434743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157195612934473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157195612934473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157195612934473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2943499416211981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.279187955171851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157195612934473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2258725741183896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157195612934473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157195612934473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157195612934473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2943499416211981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16416487415652584,0.2702518297007884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30561414821554267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28492851794585405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18328062543727885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30561414821554267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30561414821554267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18101282801898422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28492851794585405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28492851794585405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2702518297007884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2495661994310998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28492851794585405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30561414821554267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34577657768192627,0.34577657768192627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32237253541618005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27346525698548335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32237253541618005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34577657768192627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34577657768192627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34577657768192627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34577657768192627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3113357092533527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30748344000239847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5191416024772699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5191416024772699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5191416024772699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47034007266363953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4385048945446059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47034007266363953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4385048945446059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41591747620696673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3869705404332431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2458393157302956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4150643570240584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4150643570240584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29694598067263994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3108500271632719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29694598067263994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4150643570240584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6344802242791545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37128986104061945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3805057226979334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5610651290904067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3950693413059316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21221697057312935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3950693413059316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3950693413059316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3950693413059316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3346399197838188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3950693413059316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2501622659162045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3695197133563445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7009714532263167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3357218194939407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35048572661315835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3695197133563445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30172257229206934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3125832020323491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4238707638206015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.359565144739114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4238707638206015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45464351330084024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34049165163796485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44897044076030646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3101760987438956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46871463819332143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5300457172341959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44897044076030646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.529933352105073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.529933352105073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3968777229576411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.529933352105073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4894266745820435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5778075552659454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30452978239040157,0.0,0.0,0.5778075552659454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3132130199584612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4378020555999415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35751157384945886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2813984316669385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4378020555999415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4378020555999415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34624569554720547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25547429260518206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4755984416682072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28522233134464253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30569215899472196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4755984416682072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28522233134464253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4755984416682072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3752287465290787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3752287465290787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3498312210461126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24901924098445788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33181138994356174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22502937035949103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3752287465290787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3498312210461126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33181138994356174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5201915650802207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5579571438374337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47261256274497987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4412730750859229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3950461548209907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33457086621971355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30714771468433244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44673774917680137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44673774917680137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3950461548209907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28714187239825023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5778409774159077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8161493765353426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4603933094356588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3656274193294492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4160402068950759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6937327562599817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4573462255606885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27088253000041645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3425157670917995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4573462255606885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42639054179269176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4573462255606885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3823493524233144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6533792821560352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6533792821560352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46251076447971756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30978654819983176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3917077162237925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5230300697075205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3917077162237925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33118841099598956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43451999845690714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4913767257674155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4913767257674155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4913767257674155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2946847655772043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5171968901527748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5171968901527748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48219018739113556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48219018739113556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2952205768812293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5044889114570562,0.47034235391549134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4273227790943257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5044889114570562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5851519970859571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35092296815443286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4382320744015835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5851519970859571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38715760399713417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4378169853715863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37084892586308443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37084892586308443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4378169853715863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4378169853715863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36507201250693605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36507201250693605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39157600981465623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.259868044902609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3096867777198557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39157600981465623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39157600981465623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3316809248738255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2764163468192614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4020398352650023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23812499513693494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3748275892530377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31796233164838805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29402457195791615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4020398352650023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32830794743255054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32830794743255054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4003797194345095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27996487647066365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4179870617248017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4726804624248953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4726804624248953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3738300754655124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23799078127178297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375847495822658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31835822905743427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375847495822658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3323585443527808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30691913854722047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2688893935162591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375847495822658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375847495822658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38802618493685265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5643732191154511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5643732191154511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4608702842382849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4627345455191408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4204108142251577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34124327100459173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49632878098082367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49632878098082367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3385554123885894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6302646928127135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37797761577542627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5876049452725973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43691798677227295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2302748349716059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43691798677227295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31258053807806946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38636262765922086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35678963836759386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43691798677227295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37326409174791275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34799954480225603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3161699799528993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37326409174791275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37326409174791275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37326409174791275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28688403519895456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37326409174791275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5546183518587363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4386325156454989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4386325156454989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5546183518587363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2603228762292774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21667580372760542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3832889717820078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4111155088162489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4111155088162489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3635457295570043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482316811458633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3832889717820078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482212141041405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39378578808085873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3215676469664253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39378578808085873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39378578808085873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39378578808085873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39378578808085873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4751094210460875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3558189806915708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4751094210460875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4429514274492931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4751094210460875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5155579896293206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35015757980018364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.552987173738167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.552987173738167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4163754389185484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3862423540939937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5820001450898944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5820001450898944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4261832141077236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29301575810690056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3768699651926573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33705667095842673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4261832141077236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4261832141077236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33705667095842673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29109094350079645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17682362469412435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3291800497696872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1926320321097309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3291800497696872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22632271437267787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3291800497696872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.306899350916403,0.0,0.3291800497696872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24652954579422812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3291800497696872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23550249748634128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20844043952533742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3120083635750478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3120083635750478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32363713305411224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32363713305411224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38207966658737746,0.32363713305411224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3021763790731926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3562184335170479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3562184335170479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3689442559161614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5366190877542064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5366190877542064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5366190877542064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27110154816790283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32199540240283947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33399639578954576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3943096094703028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32199540240283947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2534435466368355,0.3943096094703028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31184870707128354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36762058724762947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36969814246115656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.557070891556073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.557070891556073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49261275564343043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5009475804188528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29314823442080484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5009475804188528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42432312660133553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3219853851166604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3583886884424531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3926822444889738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4440645223447125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26631104569296316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3761408456679028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3926822444889738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3325688329944895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4140078165974704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4003368231703688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5331884913877261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.745278780501322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3073272224324722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38859803671904736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3503274734617245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3335101144177765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39880013942301423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45883899549111573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38859803671904736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5565126260599812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5188448201344151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5565126260599812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33374757930408055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3357365438644549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3796675049029879,0.0,0.22769134924916357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27162231028769657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3796675049029879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6005373324785488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3357365438644549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28722156006456917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4789320868959594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4789320868959594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4789320868959594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4789320868959594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401871,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스티제이인데 지금 자기 개발 모임에서 만나는 분들이 대부분 이에스티제이거든. 그래서 조금 마음이 편해. 근데 최근에 어떤 예전에 소개팅 했던 어떤 분이 차를 탔는데 되게 지저분한 거야. 그래서 그 분을 보면서 아 이 사람은 확신에 피다 이런 생각이 들었어. 너는 엠비티아이가 뭐야? 근데 내가 너의 주변 사람들을 보면 진짜 아이가 많잖아 대부분의 사람들이 다 개발자여서 근데 그 사람들이랑 비교해서 너를 보면 너는 확신에 이이고 그냥 약간 게으른 우리가 흔히 가지는 집에서 좀 휴식을 취하는 성향의 사람 정도로 보이긴 하더라고. 그거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 음 나도 나는 이이긴 한데 솔직히 같은 이랑 있을 때 편하기는 하지만 너무 피곤해. 그래서 아이들이랑 있을 때는 내가 조금 더 능동적으로 말을 많이 해서 그 분위기를 좀 끌어 가야 되는데 근데 그렇다고 이랑 있으면 서로 좀 약간 기싸움 같은 느낌처럼 굉장히 불편할 때가 많더라고. 그래서 그런 거 보면 나도 약간 아이인가라고 생각할 때는 있는 거 같아. 예전에 우리 근데 혈액형 검사가 되게 많았었잖아 혈액형이랑 엠비티아이 비교해 보면 뭐가 더 저 좋은 거 같아? 나도 어떻게 이분법적으로 성격을 나누거나 그럴 수는 없는데 그래도 이렇게 좀 가이드라인이 되어주는 게 있어서 사람들 사이에서 조금 편하게 할 수 있는 거 같고 서로의 장단점을 좀 살리는게 가장 좋지 않을까 싶긴 해. 사실 내가 전에 다녔던 스타트업 회사는 미리 사전에 팀원들 간의 엠비티아이를 다 공유해서 서로가 어느 정도는 좀 조심할 수 있게 했는데 어떻게 하다 보니까 너는 이에스티제이잖아 너는 뭐뭐잖아라고 하니까 사람이 약간 그걸로 규정 되어지는 느낌은 좀 있더라. 그건 좀 지향하는 편인 거 같아. 우리 우정에 대해서 잠깐 얘기 해 봤으면 하는데 사실 너는 막 친구들이 엄청 많은 편은 아니지만 아니잖아. 그러면 사람을 만난 어떤 대인 관계에서 어떤 것보다는 취하는 것보다는 그냥 컴퓨터와의 상호 작용이 좀 더 좋은 거야 아니면은 그냥 내 방식이 이게 우정의 방식이야 라고 생각하는 거야? 음 나는 사람들을 통해서 에너지를 좀 많이 얻는 성향인 거 같아서 사람들이랑 에게서 상처를 받지만 그래도 계속 사람들을 만날 것 같고 내가 스트레스를 좀 대인 관계에서 받는다면 그건 직장 동료들인 거 같거든. 그 사람들의 성격이 사실 회사에서의 성격이랑 친한 관계에서의 성격이 좀 다른 거 같은데 회사에서 보는 사람들의 어떤 딱딱한 느낌 그리고 일적으로 대하는 비즈니스적인 말투 이런 거를 내가 그렇게 좋아하지 않는 거 같아. 예를 들면 지시형으로 하는 사람들의 성격 또는 그렇게 말을 함으로써 보여지는 그 사람의 어떤 느낌을 좋아하지 않더라고 그래서 나는 사실 너의 회사 사람들의 성격들이 되게 부러웠어. 다들 조곤조곤하게 매너 있게 대화 한다고 하잖아. 그게 사실 부럽더라고. 나는 사실 오늘도 수업하는데 그 회원님이 1분이 굉장히 날카롭게 인사하고 대화하셔서 어떤 생각이 들었냐면 아 그냥 이 사람을 굉장히 처음 보는 사람한테 낯 가리는게 아니라 무례한 성격이구나라는 생각이 딱 먼저 드는 거야. 그런 거 보면 사실 내가 그런 사람들을 하도 많이 만나서 이 사람은 이럴 것이다라고 약간 규정 짓는 것도 조금 있는 거 같긴 해. 근데 나는 그거를 약간 여자 세계의 사람들이 그런 거 같다라고 생각하는 거고 네가 만난 업종의 사람들은 대부분 남자잖아. 그래서 다들 차분하고 성격들이 매너있나 약간 이렇게 좀 구분지어서 생각해 본 적은 있는 것 같아. 1마디로 남성성의 사람 여성성의 사람의 성격이 차이가 많이 크다 약간 이런 생각 좀 해 봤던 거 같아. 여자들이랑 일해 본 경험은 많아. 음 나도 근데 생각해 보면 내가가 하는 일은 대부분 다 사람과 사람으로만 대화를 하면서 일이 일어나잖아. 그러니까 사람들 성격이 많이 나오는 거 같아 솔직히 말하면. 근데 네가 하는 일을 보면 방금 말했던 것처럼 컴퓨터랑 일을 하다가 어쩌다 1번씩 회의하고 대화하잖아. 그래서 좀 그럴 수도 있는데 나 같은 경우는 아침부터 만나자마자 일이 끝날 때까지 사람이랑만 계속 대화하면서 일을 해서 서로의 성격이 좀 많이 나오는 느낌이 갑자기 드는 거 같아. 그래서 더 많이 알게 되고 알고 싶지 않은 성격까지 보게 되는 그런 것도 있는 것 같아. 엠비티아이 잘 모른다고 했긴 했지만 이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 아이랑 더 잘 맞는 것 같아. 지향 내 주변에도 아이이지만 사람들이랑은 섞이는 걸 되게 좋아하는 사람들이 꽤 많아. 근데 그 사람들은 이 모임에 나오잖아 내가 하는 그 모임에. 근데 거기에 나오는 아이인 사람들을 보면 뭐 5명 이상이 넘어가면 불편해 하는데 또는 밖에 나와서 뭘 시키면 되게 힘들어 하는데 그냥 소소하게 4명 이내의 사람들끼리 대화하는 건 되게 좋아하더라고. 그래서 내가 볼 때 말을 많이 하는 거랑 집에 있는 거랑은 좀 다른 거 같아. 그러니까 아이인 사람들은 집에 있기는 하지만 나와서 사람들이랑 어울리고 다만 그 사람의 숫자가 많지 않은 정도 아니었을까 이런 생각이 들긴하더라. 나는 지금 내 성격이 사실 싫지는 않거든 그래서 그냥 이 성향대로 살면되지 않을까라는 생각은 있고 예전에는 강박증이 쪼금 심할 만큼의 어떤 제이 성향 계획적인 성향이 있었는데 요즘 그런 건 많이 내려 놓은 거 같아서 오히려 그거는 좀 개선하고 싶은 부분 중에 하나인 거 같아. 그리고 또 하나는 연극하고 이러다 보니까 엄청 감성적이고 감수성이 있었지만 지금은 그런 부분도 많이 없어져서 오히려 나이 들수록 그 부분이 좀 아쉬운 조금 더 많이 느끼고 싶거든 세상의 어떤 찬란함이라든지 이런 거 그래서 그런 거는 오히려 지금 티에서 에프로 좀 더 가고싶지 않나라는 생각도 하는 것 같아. 혹시 기억나는 직장 동료 중 동료 있어? 나는 사람이 너무 많아서 서로가 막 이야기하고 있으면 그래서 이가 많은 걸 싫어하는 것 같은데 이들 끼리만 있으면 난 조용해 져. 갑자기 막 내가 내뺀다 거나 약간 그렇게 해서 사람들이 의아해 너 인데 왜 빼냐고 연극도 했다면서 왜 빼냐 이러는데 사실 그 에너지에 약간 좀 질리는 느낌도 있는 거 같아. 나는 직장 동료 중에는 사실 기억나는 선생님이 1분 계신데 그분 에너지가 진짜 넘치거든 그런데 너무 넘쳐서 약간 가끔은 사람들한테 좀 무례했던 그런 걸 보고 나도 내가 이 이면 사실 말을 많이 하다보면 실수도 하게 되잖아. 그래서 나중에는 언젠가부터는 좀 말을 많이 하고 즐겁게 하는 거랑 상대방이 기분 나쁠 수 있는 거랑 구분하는 연습을 좀 하게 됐어. 그분을 보고 그래서 그분이 생각나는데 사실 그분이랑 있으면 좀 재밌긴 해. 재밌는데 가끔은 도가 좀 지나치는데라고 할 때가 있어. 근데도 지금 생각하면 그분이 좀 재밌어서 생각이 나는 거 같긴 해. 나 요즘 최근에 모임에서 사람들을 새롭게 너무 많이 만나다 보니까 서로 이 그 엠비티아이에 대해서 진짜 많이 얘기하거든. 근데 우리 아까 이게 조금 혈액형에 비하면 좋다고 얘기했지만 사실상 이게 너무 유행하니까 너무 규정 지어지는 것에 대해서는 쪼금 불편함이 있는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 최근에 내가 어떤 행사에 가기 싫었는데 네가 낯을 가린다는 말은 어떻게 이해해야 되니라고 물어보길래 진짜 낯 가려요 이렇게 했거든. 근데 누가 봐도 내 엠비티아이 내가 막 말하고 다니고 했는데 뻔히 봐도 엑스트라벌트라고 이제 그 외향적인 사람을 의미하잖아. 그런데 낯을 가린다고 말하니까 그분도 되게 새삼스럽게 했을 거고 나도 그렇게 말하면서 민망하지만 진짜 사람이 너무 많은 자리에 나가기 싫었거든. 그래서 아 이런 게 가끔은 나를 너무 조금 불편하게 하는 경우도 생길 수 있구나라는 걸 좀 생각했던 것 같아. 아까 말했던 것처럼 회사에서 굉장히 좋게 쓰이는 것도 있고 또 너무 이걸로 초면에 얘기하니까 그 사람을 규정 짓는 것도 있고 약간 양날의 검 같은 느낌이네. 나는 위에 오빠가 있잖아. 그래서 동생 약간 어떤 개구져야 되는 막 그런 귀여워야 되는 이런 성향이 좀 있었던 것 같아서 그렇게 더 성장을 한 것 같아. 어떻게 보면 좀 더 말을 많이 하고 집에서 약간 좀 더 귀염성 있는 막내 느낌 그렇게 하다 보니까 밖에서도 그런 것 같고 그러다 보니까 사실 손 윗사람은 편한데 손 아랫사람은 좀 어려워. 그러니까 동생들이랑 있으면 내가 다 챙겨줘야 될 거 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2785844012295398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.398602649714634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.273335832722342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5186208981997282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38840559919116735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5186208981997282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4571687991393144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5625382918255308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6888739792759857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29467745745461055,0.36304185415168255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36304185415168255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4286001092722129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3995901192383083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4286001092722129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34999721371335507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2571978189331116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3090076272140498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48800101524046713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43153488814125324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4549704483264724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4549704483264724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34203187451573136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5401546347354623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4271935565737253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5401546347354623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34203187451573136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5363560756967013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.612355126967852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5808126707807089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5068334286884576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47252818144979314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36259955106394975,0.0,0.0,0.5068334286884576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36259955106394975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7630523892598732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6463366392560451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.379789059815431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23070342679882913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4294842708209649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25438011592363974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4294842708209649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4294842708209649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4294842708209649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5523450071810936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5523450071810936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29110990901436706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5523450071810936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3180290506604874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525669654220705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37899770230411384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28739095317788244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4792145440946693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4467786934088286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4237650911026347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4078225301445495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4078225301445495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44887896969709173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4257571820097588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36058052317663114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.393168852593195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5345645693844981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45279809368850743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5345645693844981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47271061831694194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3006715329204896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26643645414316675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40147346173957926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40147346173957926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32784544368714624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40147346173957926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32784544368714624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37429955097292267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47751163722143297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31689892248943674,0.0,0.0,0.40447192244128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47751163722143297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3576180485968762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3899386372695897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5138322607866692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6066203127883456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6066203127883456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5512714777097428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4428315231142839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5512714777097428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4428315231142839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3894601354764153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2584638523224799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3298886926128228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3894601354764153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3298886926128228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3298886926128228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3894601354764153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3894601354764153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34202869074672265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32393447206182613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5401496067608373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44108914875378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5401496067608373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5171968901527749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4821901873911356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5171968901527749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4821901873911356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49835195567594026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49835195567594026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40695695629046513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49835195567594026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.298867898156857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3976701075010282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6902058369295333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6045447777199989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4467297802413134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4164926753216364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2679094341742979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4467297802413134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39503910796334696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4467297802413134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.338093308474552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41653006865577497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3682793837345446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4917472486972205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4015635161350943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41653006865577497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5271361113796065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5271361113796065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6665245983151517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29502722230247513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3293808989434861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5492313365306125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5492313365306125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4485053393854538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2622663834718118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2984277290837401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49761798886395175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49761798886395175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49761798886395175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3150972010214091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5438447597272843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38907825443930866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5438447597272843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5070343839985662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3596930203223274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6824729689401265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6362794808867022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23878115334177358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3981593723524477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35208873515527284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35208873515527284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33725730269213955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3981593723524477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3251391400105964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3981593723524477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46290122657730903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46290122657730903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46290122657730903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46290122657730903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37800769533554657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.725546298295606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6881733568146499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37425692083776624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37425692083776624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23698361164172546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37425692083776624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37425692083776624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3489251738112441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37425692083776624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3489251738112441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49108642561819354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5797670248624216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4734409509351112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44559845762006445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6875930218634075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5387209238767452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.486821941229166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2707958900279252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40429778130324007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42625416361868623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4571999464174691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4571999464174691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40429778130324007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7902548903722184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.612778270047815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38085728245172523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44963265532388463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44963265532388463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26965032465272143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44963265532388463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4191990680062959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5725887084428708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.543094623305146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.614158286682486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4615044270852138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5079651476519241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48179982673145816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5448430962334426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30015063316630325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33942519535588533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31645104924273887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30015063316630325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30015063316630325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25420234094001026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33942519535588533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2684421220708867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33942519535588533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25420234094001026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2875070481830758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3820103739193893,0.2052021653026813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33780832176521225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.356153830954275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3820103739193893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2732984492427515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3820103739193893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3820103739193893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2418931836808066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5608892345630686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5608892345630686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4580252432325212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4012722388407897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3018387195907707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.476679501173431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.476679501173431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.476679501173431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.476679501173431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37149795446192824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2639461576698064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31165569149932193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3524356848926575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31165569149932193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31165569149932193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31165569149932193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2787317631117359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3524356848926575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2787317631117359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19730310057519856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3743582033089834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3743582033089834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3310415764403647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3743582033089834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3310415764403647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2678239215755887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3743582033089834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3310415764403647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.270971894312135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22553935266127945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4279329954349491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4279329954349491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4279329954349491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3784172810090882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4279329954349491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24241166045222165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3822532118393418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2640837774973923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27063865500612827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23784459136575573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3468461613482971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4512806622443726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2900618418137934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27063865500612827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3379731449906007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25182302667814027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3056589621090493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2685072580253384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31452382777514193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33686150522604713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3516755318588528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31452382777514193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3516755318588528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2978395964279437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3516755318588528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4160256014483718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29090523436759264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4911516845832081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4160256014483718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4911516845832081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29454980556559657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3592023028384795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4100995247906627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26053297608386883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43987249102357145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3725900233732627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38897526907138824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38897526907138824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8059960356744674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5919209326227977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6574672665196564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6236010808124112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4229166412719697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3875211393204683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36071752338727175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37760757592747235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4700755829485281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31926675904443386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5042027730865453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44116671445854233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28473246261215834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4576093058220929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38650261711218525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39509812477933476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4576093058220929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3998869788741379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32654991302699005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3998869788741379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3998869788741379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3998869788741379,0.33872065620351394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3728204499095848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4710570882395838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24826763040339794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4710570882395838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4391733786006969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4710570882395838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28249882491802647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2781831173522772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19075993118765788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3619433495701163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3619433495701163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2955649360116308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3619433495701163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2170619517107188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3619433495701163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33744505212055037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33744505212055037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24706224625690257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5516615323291324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4599383292800486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4599383292800486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4599383292800486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43803839622265556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2563345696845685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43803839622265556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43803839622265556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43803839622265556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4083895715164164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.487628336892252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29062990767415164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5514342640717096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3307020221306251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5141101893479821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31218759939456847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2978703799688132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3720363992303636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41598151559991636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4704124915795455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4385724117538085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2978703799688132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7314268564712422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6819199026517683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3310670684256551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30710774920788914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3919750207508829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46275803961604384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46275803961604384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46275803961604384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38835831466699205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4918255396045051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38835831466699205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3171355422346223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23290333651612635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38835831466699205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38835831466699205,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48036474063103907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48036474063103907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3922684972537457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3922684972537457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48036474063103907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5083804314316558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5083804314316558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47397047462061437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5083804314316558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.649600147361599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3248000736807995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23236896825641012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30281583546748847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30281583546748847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1947866647989947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30281583546748847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3248000736807995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40944694929204645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25926632592848525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2929271661934104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40944694929204645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40944694929204645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36207023744705663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25926632592848525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38173334945525567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3840258909650224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3840258909650224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40488135857080093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43427548923509757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40488135857080093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43427548923509757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35015757980018364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5155579896293206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.552987173738167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.552987173738167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.3522405384292754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3522405384292754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18564612653355386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3522405384292754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3522405384292754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3522405384292754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3522405384292754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3522405384292754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31148312524512006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3100752058296467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36990137766813325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5170397563097354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4820436892225207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5170397563097354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2784430025018732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.518357666178039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4832723957721178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4583790002589975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4583790002589975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2299982365578062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36322525096113006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25985916768436634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29661174375946814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36322525096113006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36322525096113006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36322525096113006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36322525096113006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36322525096113006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28594325288719696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33757900922878104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33757900922878104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33757900922878104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19994536083208972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26698202385638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2985180674564649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33757900922878104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31472982304912356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31472982304912356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2528196950971499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26758198362897945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25828491062419534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34415764362968165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30780014424183993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32966030151530334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34415764362968165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3891905014156749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3891905014156749,0.34415764362968165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4267242573623789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27541118736543413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4426285682697321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5225586266649775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5225586266649775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33491684312556863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46813916737836453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46813916737836453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3965330564536205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38228502669012304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38228502669012304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36511160044960234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39161847181693243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39161847181693243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.346304675916081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39161847181693243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36511160044960234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39161847181693243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2964989481782945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3103820630484003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28494155041496955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3863879819303927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4144395051421974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3664851094720098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4144395051421974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32776889209338594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46098910133695714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4188250160241759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38003042115884017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4944566186544917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3537449145938711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31309538652377106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35558151701779395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43133179570788077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40911386420201484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43133179570788077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46264621138623574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34648503284530485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39538140714308134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3587583284812356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41276894060910735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41276894060910735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.466779552736979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39538140714308134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3804663848677092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5610071244837048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5017412137519983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5373751861473439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45377480376183427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2565219131124692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48671856763632854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3974570674387701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3849324296936962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43040083131326434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6178930644981482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5241522372691962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5860653487545424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46496644600946896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46496644600946896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3677292704440245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46496644600946896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46496644600946896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6824729689401265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3596930203223274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6362794808867022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21746755854825137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37744194351452487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37744194351452487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37744194351452487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23978587366789755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3201800610807223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37744194351452487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2427900021111621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4048439899930661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40149055670029815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6860888087469192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.606702133993872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2502109525471843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3639248231919675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3082592368158334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27970604216836387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3082592368158334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3639248231919675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3218154326801657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33929240881434025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23044121341310927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3639248231919675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48219018739113556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5171968901527748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48219018739113556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5171968901527748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30178894436456555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43894356782185145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43894356782185145,0.0,0.43894356782185145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3718031873594091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43894356782185145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6093875064020811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7928725414851076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45140122156876233,0.45140122156876233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38235533052693627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31035401388408373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38235533052693627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45140122156876233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3062617064090975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.399110497386353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3785522872510456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3062617064090975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4280856671770249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4280856671770249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3785522872510456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2787622663997987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3780087158075003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34343438054434994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29006902874981905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29006902874981905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4054519095961953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4054519095961953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4054519095961953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4737348938492187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39053780383315945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5081277476451921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32660045663300913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5081277476451921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4569395956880573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4334026045820482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4901131214555987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35063748314752463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4901131214555987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4321175148773669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33896428915632865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4634889732706911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36656077758395983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4634889732706911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36656077758395983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2901654397695397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.253101168558285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4220375059106803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4220375059106803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37320395289513003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4220375059106803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4220375059106803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4342629758717661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5317904018057422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5317904018057422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49579593068274824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29785239299775046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3052454482254742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3377869729166324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5089863013809064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5089863013809064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4311322526373217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3363060782232487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3607216868879353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3055460491199855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25806806402463073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3607216868879353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3607216868879353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3607216868879353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3055460491199855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3363060782232487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43598502113338117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4722555221512142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5107038026009589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5710283785889544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3951145616636278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4995931199099125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4995931199099125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3574196782219819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4657779362082468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4608702842382849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38802618493685265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5643732191154511,0.0,0.0,0.5643732191154511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42897101539688826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42897101539688826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36389163491669463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4601140399171618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2759361420303569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4601140399171618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32092903008573553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2810987082059173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3442282747770825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18142331413828536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3442282747770825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.688456549554165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27224074648045443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3841405327193799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7151272908122976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5839768908591628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3551066601490927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40157219134200195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23499500443933308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37439159801806093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26650197569737977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3175924848344763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24082786355647404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40157219134200195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3551066601490927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.372713097875012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6369123284668553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43002006383183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5201061211151138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2946847655772043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4913767257674155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4913767257674155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4913767257674155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43451999845690714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3976701075010282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6902058369295333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6045447777199989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4266983469321745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.300283899673002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43790072045873524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5038261194964034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5311876322519572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24488364053938008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38615121875104086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3261482114753176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4558825729309571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3261482114753176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4031328398330628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4558825729309571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4882834136230713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4882834136230713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3296712205267728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45523373244828264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45523373244828264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5088313162040182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4017865208254219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30880585872372596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4017865208254219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4017865208254219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4017865208254219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40979940951938343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.68332644097375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.604259397133146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2835868216731203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20288412011894508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20288412011894508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2835868216731203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19497578691748352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24020965773437075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2835868216731203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2643921208494235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2835868216731203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25077326388089743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2835868216731203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2643921208494235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2643921208494235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2643921208494235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21238386223350367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17957030444128078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때?

그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.244952720449273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45601117411881287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42514585390459436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45601117411881287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4032465607014279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42514585390459436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5119714807362367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8590024463950876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40839921855351824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27026183101356116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4618380547073965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40839921855351824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40839921855351824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4618380547073965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401872,30대,나는 엠비티아이가 이에스에프제이인데 원래 내 생각에는 나 같은 경우는 아이일 것 같은데 최근에 내가 그 캠핑을 하면 원래는 되게 좀 집에서 이렇게 방콕을 하는 거 되게 좋아했는데 최근에 캠핑을 하면서 뭔가 내 성격이 그에 맞춰서 좀 바뀌면서 이 요즘에는 좀 이가 좀 많이 오른 것 같아 그래 가지고 요즘에 이에스에프제이로 내가 그 검사를 했더니 나오더라고 맞아. 나도 보니까 사실 내가 그 엠비티아이를 잘 아는 건 아니지만 어 아이 성향 사람들은 대부분 집에 있으면 에너지가 다시 차 오른다고 하더라고. 그런데 나는 어 요즘 캠핑 때문에 아무래도 야생성이 좀 생겨서 이로 나오는 것 같지만 나도 집에 있으면 에너지가 차는 타입이 해. 그런데 또 아이들이랑 같이 있으면 나도 모르게 그 중에서는 제일 이가 되는 경향이 있어. 사실 이게 되게 어려운 질문인데 질문에 대한 답을 하면 아무래도 좀 더 다양한 요소가 들어가 있는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 맞는 것 같아. 왜냐하면 혈액형은 사실 4가지 밖에 없잖아. 그런데 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 좀 더 다채롭게 사람을 이렇게 체크할 수 있고 그런 부분에서는 엠비티아이가 좀 더 나은 거 같아. 근데 사실 엠비티아이에서 내가 이고 아이고 하는 건 그렇게 중요한 것 같진 않아. 내가 만약에 아이일 땐 어 이가 제시하는 그런 성격들이 바라보고 아이가 이처럼 살 수 있을 때 그러니까 거기에서 이에서 나타나는 좋은 점을 아이가 받아들이고 그것을 또 자기 삶에 적용하는게 되게 중요한 것 같다고 생각하거든. 이 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 맞아. 나도 사실 그걸 요즘은 또 이력서에도 엠비티아이를 많이 작성을 하더라고. 근데 그게 좋게 보일 때도 있지만 사실 그걸 우리가 해석하는 방식이 어 좀 그걸 받아들이고 아 이 사람은 이렇겠구나 이런 성격을 가지고 있겠구나를 생각을 하고 하지만 그 사람한테 진짜 그 프레임을 덧씌우는 건 조금 올바른 처세는 아닌 것 같다라는 생각을 하기 또 하는 것 같아. 이게 조금 성격인 부분인데 상처 받는 걸 되게 싫어하고 무서워해서 친 사람 대 사람으로는 서로 내가 잘못 말을 해서 내가 상처를 줄 수도 있고 또 어떤 상황에서는 내가 그 사람으로 인해서 상처를 받을 수도 있잖아. 근데 그 컴퓨터는 내가 상처받을 일이 별로 없더라고 그래서 좀 그런 대인 관계를 내가 좀 약간 소극적으로 하고 있는 거 같아. 근데 너는 사람들이랑 이렇게 소통을 하고 상호 작용을 하다 보면 좀 상처받는 모습도 많이 보고 있는 것 같은데 앞으로도 계속해서 사람들하고 상호 작용을 많이 할 거야? 그게 사실 매너 있는 사람들 그러니까 회사라서 그렇게 말을 하는 게 아니라 내가 사람들을 아까 말했던 것처럼 뭔가 좀 name1가 말해던 말했던 것처럼 좀 딱딱하게 말하거나 혹은 좀 날이 있는 사람들과는 내가 소통하는 게 좀 어려워서 아 친구가 적어진 이유가 그러니까 내가 너에게 보여줄 수 있는 내 주변 사람들이 죄다 그런 사람들만 남아서 그런 거 같아. 그래서 어딜 가나 상황은 비슷하긴 한데 그건 좀 내가 아쉬운 부분이긴해 사실. 왜냐하면 나도 사람들이랑 이야기를 하는 걸 되게 좋아하더라고 나이가 들수록 아 그냥 나도 컴퓨터만 보고 살던 삶이 좀 되게 심심했구나 되게 단조롭구나라고 요즘 후회하고 있는 편이야. 아무래도 디자인 팀에 있을 때에는 팀의 과반수가 여자 분들이셨는데 그때도 알고 있는 분들 중에 name2 name2 님 처럼 뭔가 좀 되게 차분하고 항상 뭔가 다 받아주고 하는 분도 계시고 또 그 알려줬던 좀 다른 직원분들은 동료 분들 중에는 또 되게 후배들을 잘 케어해 주고 내가 그때 1달 동안 커피를 얻어 먹었다고 했던 사람있잖아. 그런 분들처럼 뭔가 좀 포용해 주고 차분하고 했던 분들은 있었던 거 같아. 근데 아무래도 이쪽 직업의 특성상 뭔가 좀 혼자 디자인을 하느라 컴퓨터랑 소통을 하고 거의 친구가 많이 없어서 그런가라는 생각이 드네 갑자기. 나는 이를 지향하 지향하는 아이 같은 사람이 되고 싶어. 지향하는 왜냐면 어쨌든 그 내가 아까 이야기했던 것처럼 그냥 집에 있을 때 에너지가 쌓인다 그랬잖아. 그거는 정말 빼도박도 못하고 아이라고 생각을 하거든. 그런데 너무 아이 성향에 맞춰서 그냥 집 안에만 있고 그 뭔가 대인 관계를 좀 멀리 하는 것보다는 어 요즘은 이제는 좀 더 대인 사람들과 소통을 하고 대인 관계를 좀 더 중요시하게 생각하는 하지만 아이인 그런 사람이 되고 싶어. 맞아. 그런데 내가 요즘 강사 일을 시작하고 있잖아. 이 강사 일을 하면서 이 20분의 학생들을 가르치다 보니까 확실히 어 내가 생각했던 것보다 사람들이랑 소통하는 것에 대한 재미를 좀 많이 느끼고 있는 거 같아. 그래서 앞으로도 되도록이면 좀 캠핑 같은 활동도 계속하고 또 대인 관계를 위해서 상호 작용을 하는 연습을 계속해서 쪼끔 뭐랄까 늦었지만 인싸 같은 삶을 살아보고 싶어. 너는 어때? 아무래도 그 name3님이 갑자기 딱 떠오르는데 name3님 같은 경우는 음 성격이 그냥 우리가 봐 누가 봐도 딱 아이거든 아인데 어떨 때 특히 좀 뭔가 이 같은 성격이 막 나올 때가 있거든. 그러니까 자기가 좀 약간 궁지에 몰릴 때 그럴 때 궁지에 몰렸다라기 보다는 뭔가 일을 주도적으로 해서 사람들을 좀 이끌고 가야 될 때 그런 리더십이 필요할 때 이 같은 성향이 잠깐씩 나오는데 그게 생각보다 멋있어 보이더라고. 그래서 나도 그런 부분은 좀 배워보고 싶어. 너도 이라고 이야기했지만 혹시 아이의 성격이 막 나올 때가 있어? 그 사 사람이 재밌는 사람들을 보면 그 사람의 장난이 조금 심했다던가 혹은 어 좀 그게 너무 또 지각도가 지나쳐서 좀 불쾌했던라든가라는 걸 느낄 때 그분 그 사람의 그 재미 있는 부분 그 선만 딱 내가 같이 캐치를 캐치를 해서 내 것으로 만드는 것도 좋은 방법인 것 같아. 그래서 어 그러면 나도 좀 재밌는 사람의 장점을 가지고 올 수 있는 거잖아. 그래서 긍정적으로 생각해 보면 또 그런 재밌는 말들을 배웠다라고 생각하고 넘어가면 좋은 것 같아. 그런데 내가 봤을 때 생각보다 너는 그걸 그렇게 뭔가 두려워하고 있지는 않은 것 같아. 항상 보면 긍정적이고 또 사람들과 만나면 그 무리에서 어떻게 되게 이끌어가는 자리를 또 되게 좋아하잖아. 그런 모습을 봤을 때 뭐 굳이 그렇게 막 사람들한테 기를 빨리고 하는 건 그냥 네가 하고 싶은 게 너무 정말 많아서 그 에너지를 사용하기 때문이지 사람들한테 기가 빨리는 느낌은 아닌 것 같아. 내가 봤을 땐 그래서 앞으로도 계속 그 성격을 잊지 말고 살아갔으면 좋을 것 같아.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3550806885653281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6610286319850193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6610286319850193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
