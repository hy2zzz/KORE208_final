SD2400442,20대,너는 친한 친구 분은 어떤 사람이 있어? 그 교회 친구? 저번에 그 도서관에서 말했던 그 저번에 도서관에서 말했던 그 친구? 나는 언니 1명 동아 대학교에서 만난 동아리 동아리에서 만난 동아리에서 만난 친구 언닌데 1살 언닌데 그냥 꾸준하게 내 어떤 모습도 다 봐도 보여줘도 그냥 계속 내 옆에 있어 주고 서로 약간 말 못 할 비밀 다 주고 막 그러면서도 지켜주고 되게 착한 언니야. 응 너는 그 친구의 장점은 뭐라 생각해? 내가 생각해도 너는 약간 관용적인 것 같긴 해. 그게 그 친구한테서 배웠던 것 같은데 약간 맞아? 우선 언니는 좀 귀여운 스타일인데 내가 좀 귀여운 스타일 좋아하고 잘 웃고 그러니까 나도 막 내가 치는 드립이나 개그에 언니가 되게 잘 웃어 줘. 그게 제일 좋았고 그냥 딱 보자마자 아 뭔가 내 과 같다 약간 그 느낌이 있잖아. 그런 느낌을 보니까 들 그 느낌 들었고 얘기하다 보니까 또 잘 맞고 또 잘 받아 주고 나의 뭐 약간 어떠한 쪼끔 약한 모습도 다 인정해 주고 좋아해 주고 나도 언니한테 막 잘해 주고 하니까 믿게 되고 나도 너처럼 약간 선한 그 영향력 선하니까 약간 확실히 좋아하게 되는 것 같아 그 사람을. 그러면 뭐 친구 얘기는 뭐 여기까지 하고 너는 뭐 엠비티아이 뭐야? 나는 근데 너처럼 확 변하진 않고 아이에스티피. 약간 맨 처음에 근데 좀 인팁이 좀 나오긴 했었는데 아이에스티피가 약간 좀 제일 적은 엠비티아이라고 하니까 그 희소성이 너무 매력적이여서 그걸 유지하고 싶었거든. 근데 이제 지금 잇팁에서 인제 인팁이 많이 나와. 아 잘 안 나와 에스가. 거의 엔으로 많이 나오고 근데 난 너처럼 그렇게 확 막 드라마틱하게 변하지 않아 가지고 근데 아 이 이프피였나 인프피에서 이프피에서 엔 엔피제 너무 확 변했는데? 왜 이렇게 확 변했지? 좀 생각의 확장인 것 같아. 요즘에는 그냥 현상만 보고 왜 저래 이렇게 막 함부로 막 생각하고 막 이랬었는데 저렇게 된 경우 이유가 있겠지 막 경우가 있겠지. 이러면서 약간 좀 사고력 상상력을 좀 키워 나가다 보니까 좀 그게 잘 엔으로 확장이 된 거 아닌가 약간 이런 생각. 그래 약간 쪼끔 막 그냥 쪼끔 뭐 이 상황 뭘까 막 이런 생각도 하면서 약간 사고의 확장을 하면서 에스가 약간 좀 현실만 쪼끔 현실적으로 말하는 건데 엔은 좀 상상이 좀 풍부한 사람이잖아. 근데 그런 거 보면서 약간 그 생각을 좀 더 그렇게 하니까 좀 더 호기심을 갖고 세상을 좀 생각해 보다 보니까 그렇게 된 좀 바뀐 것 같기도 해. 약간 그런데 너 알바할 때 그분 알바할 때 음 그분 좋아?

왜 이렇게 확 변했지? 좀 생각의 확장인 것 같아. 요즘에는 그냥 현상만 보고 왜 저래 이렇게 막 함부로 막 생각하고 막 이랬었는데 저렇게 된 경우 이유가 있겠지 막 경우가 있겠지. 이러면서 약간 좀 사고력 상상력을 좀 키워 나가다 보니까 좀 그게 잘 엔으로 확장이 된 거 아닌가 약간 이런 생각. 그래 약간 쪼끔 막 그냥 쪼끔 뭐 이 상황 뭘까 막 이런 생각도 하면서 약간 사고의 확장을 하면서 에스가 약간 좀 현실만 쪼끔 현실적으로 말하는 건데 엔은 좀 상상이 좀 풍부한 사람이잖아. 근데 그런 거 보면서 약간 그 생각을 좀 더 그렇게 하니까 좀 더 호기심을 갖고 세상을 좀 생각해 보다 보니까 그렇게 된 좀 바뀐 것 같기도 해. 약간 그런데 너 알바할 때 그분 알바할 때 음 그분 좋아?

왜 이렇게 확 변했지? 좀 생각의 확장인 것 같아. 요즘에는 그냥 현상만 보고 왜 저래 이렇게 막 함부로 막 생각하고 막 이랬었는데 저렇게 된 경우 이유가 있겠지 막 경우가 있겠지. 이러면서 약간 좀 사고력 상상력을 좀 키워 나가다 보니까 좀 그게 잘 엔으로 확장이 된 거 아닌가 약간 이런 생각. 그래 약간 쪼끔 막 그냥 쪼끔 뭐 이 상황 뭘까 막 이런 생각도 하면서 약간 사고의 확장을 하면서 에스가 약간 좀 현실만 쪼끔 현실적으로 말하는 건데 엔은 좀 상상이 좀 풍부한 사람이잖아. 근데 그런 거 보면서 약간 그 생각을 좀 더 그렇게 하니까 좀 더 호기심을 갖고 세상을 좀 생각해 보다 보니까 그렇게 된 좀 바뀐 것 같기도 해. 약간 그런데 너 알바할 때 그분 알바할 때 음 그분 좋아?

SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4442242607465122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32448136713119596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.389041296572301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4442242607465122,0.4442242607465122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.389041296572301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2717818556535107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23290037924740228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23290037924740228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35046713623114284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35046713623114284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20584316613270073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21985867695621752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2814639661552352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29291547231598425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30693098313950107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24937931922434248,0.32500011924687694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23290037924740228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41087596755129785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5625009366722293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49262526400144624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5216262884471551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34332000801474055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41077509176429117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27887013970980684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41077509176429117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3597472907738763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41077509176429117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41077509176429117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26490767698026485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20543181537875518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3111814451356306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20543181537875518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2456579168416441,0.0,0.1605927920774647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26490767698026485,0.0,0.0,0.26490767698026485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2456579168416441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2456579168416441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2456579168416441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26490767698026485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26490767698026485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26490767698026485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2456579168416441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26490767698026485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2453447206066928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34236553719418744,0.0,0.2453447206066928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2863037134449957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21053554688311743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26967538727705936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3233309303627437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34236553719418744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3691933087370296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3691933087370296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2627041638914205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27667698469608487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46471338274447915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3567794849819734,0.0,0.0,0.3308537753665617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3308537753665617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26813889833428284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25387095073968824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31245919165812813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3567794849819734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2371694330736665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2371694330736665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2422890195331408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22388867694647213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2606893621198095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3309573573032966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3568911836017059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3568911836017059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3568911836017059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3309573573032966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3309573573032966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4337476367664821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4337476367664821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2944659169677104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2944659169677104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4337476367664821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4022289655689297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3168287700707677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3391505324473547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4373401438896104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40556041985582153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4373401438896104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4373401438896104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3830123468178152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3364097443926968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2547912800770914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.433805852984786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26298253770713853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.433805852984786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.433805852984786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.433805852984786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3596986350453781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3596986350453781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3525098066897773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4347017586130695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36746316118015077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5412724141453312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3300103695025569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.376820182645346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22132134924988728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3149409755354654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.376820182645346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.376820182645346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.376820182645346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27524639879396506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3149409755354654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5062071094389112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3436577586168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5062071094389112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5062071094389112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3363962425518212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4401891663794414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2200945831897207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16076697641762472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1839519376409877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2200945831897207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14941949595792095,0.2200945831897207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13342612052045688,0.0,0.0,0.33082574279077004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3679038752819754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19275372729255286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14941949595792095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2200945831897207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20410120775225662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2200945831897207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2200945831897207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14626224999703655,0.2200945831897207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29445021478149824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27314780942370004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41088964829293134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4430869707923312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4430869707923312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3558479619289231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3880452844283229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2675172792901532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1777766568127464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1777766568127464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17422366620632349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2480778899981037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2480778899981037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21484603450636858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2675172792901532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2675172792901532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2675172792901532,0.0,0.2675172792901532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23428542379841802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2675172792901532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2675172792901532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23428542379841802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2675172792901532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23428542379841802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40739915920812214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4393229669007822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40739915920812214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34068818109311344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40739915920812214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4393229669007822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4038794836199056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3497768603033501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4355274894507327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4355274894507327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38142486613417714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4355274894507327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44529956160194284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28203642463287604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3856484146101578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42054209872535764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44529956160194284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44529956160194284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36726179796788655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36726179796788655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2682645249933404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34057438143262664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34057438143262664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2682645249933404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32163935806386024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36726179796788655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34057438143262664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41018292205041573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2522394237566548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44232486546483846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2681469482501229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41018292205041573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36968886235109477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44232486546483846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3352426867804353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2227830824045846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2227830824045846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3108819684263541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3352426867804353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20323140388880417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21030791750523212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21030791750523212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3352426867804353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3352426867804353,0.0,0.0,0.3352426867804353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3352426867804353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3721368566677056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3721368566677056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4128990586837033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27932125369378297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27932125369378297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44525383862856116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44525383862856116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5487521362008906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.508876557214896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5487521362008906,0.372541052163427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.568679602504649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49803639612307343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32429426070630635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.568679602504649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5721523456585377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5403422077674641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.616986216914459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4059172998827584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5766632154938852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44701977080730254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5503308151099032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41287085583860034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41287085583860034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31029456877120704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41287085583860034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41287085583860034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38286921513978356,0.2743703159704847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41316438890376883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4943424088420621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3101160044281135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4943424088420621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4943424088420621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29046902242789735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2492576744192377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43709609569173874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3285011344498152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29673914440291893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43709609569173874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29046902242789735,0.0,0.0,0.43709609569173874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23375425412772552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23375425412772552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22908251215655095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2824958880919565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35175204218524053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35175204218524053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30805627394985796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23880011985657393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2727782803919335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35175204218524053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30805627394985796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2569355022340551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3544998729962357,0.3544998729962357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48532045278523867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3897661303315362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3544998729962357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48532045278523867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31789597750728943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31789597750728943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2727933305878302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47836801819043057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4436069659131907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4436069659131907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31789597750728943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.350076649951466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.350076649951466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32463800801207193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6492760160241439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32463800801207193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.350076649951466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2791327912665161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5284383002937278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3130711429646117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29097351597398186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3974584819301954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34421599895208865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42860333791767236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2319507868219042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2319507868219042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45463017680796086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19904192612240318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2803163679796748,0.0,0.3056795496395567,0.349038195071723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2803163679796748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2803163679796748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.349038195071723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27067373383614673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2400443,20대,어 일단 고등학교 친구들이 주로 내 친한 친구들인데 어 그중에서 이제 내가 가장 좋아하는 친구 같은 경우에는 그 친구가 지금 공익을 하고 있는데 그 공익에서도 이제 좀 그 장애인 학교에서 근무를 하고 있어. 근데 그 친구가 얘기를 들어보면 어 되게 선하다라는 그 단어가 떠오르는 거야 그 친구를 보면. 그래서 내가 항상 좀 고민이 있거나 아니면 다른 사람들이 예민하게 받아들일 만한 문제들을 내가 그 친구한테 많이 물어보는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 좀 그런 친구 같은 경우에는 좀 오랫동안 보고 싶은 경우가 있지. 교회에서 만난 친구라기보다는 교회를 지금 다니고 있는 친구지 정확히 말하면. 어 맞아 맞아 맞아. 그러면 누나는 그러면 가장 친한 친구 분은 혹시 누구 있어? 어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난?

어 그 친구의 장점 같은 경우에는 일단 자신만의 어떤 잣대라든가 이런 게 있긴 한데 그거를 강요를 안 하는 게 난 되게 좋다고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다른 인생을 사고 살고 누구나 인생을 한번 밖에 안 사니까 자신의 인생 안에서만 그런 가치관들이나 아니면 도덕 관념들을 형성을 하게 되는데 그 친구 같은 경우에는 본인만의 그런 도덕관념이 있음에도 불구하고 자신의 도덕관념이랑 반한다고 해서 그 사람한테 비난을 하거나 비판을 하거나 그러지 말아 달라라는 식으로는 잘 안 하는 편이거든. 그래서 나는 그런 되게 관용적인 태도가 되게 좋다라고 생각을 해. 어 가장 일단 내가 이 철학과에 들어오고 나서 가장 가장 그 일상생활에서 도움될 만한 요소가 뭐가 있는지 생각을 해 봤는데 1가지의 주제에 대해서 여러 사람들의 입장을 우리가 듣다 보니까 저 사람은 저런 생각을 가지고 저런 주장을 했구나. 이런 식으로 나와 다른 생각을 가진 사람들의 입장을 쪼금 더 잘 생각하게 되는 경향이 좀 생긴 것 같아. 그래서 조금 그런 부분들이 나한테 도움이 되는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그 누나 분의 성격은 어떤 장점이 있다 생각해? 아 엠비티아이 같은 경우는 내가 맨 처음에 했을 때는 아이엔에프피가 나왔고 그다음 했을 때가 이제 아이에스에프피가 나왔는데 가장 최근에 했을 때는 또 이엔에프제이가 나왔더라고. 그래서 내가 성격이 많이 변했구나를 좀 느낄 수 있었지. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 어떤 엠비티아이야? 아 그 일단 내가 아주 예전에는 좀 나가는 것도 별로 안 좋아하고 이랬는데 가장 큰 영향력을 받은 게 올해 겨울 방학 때 내가 투잡을 했었잖아. 그때 이제 아르바이트를 하면서 같이 근무를 했던 분이랑 이제 대화를 많이 하다 보니까 그분의 영향을 좀 많이 받은 것 같아. 그분이 어쨌든 되게 외향적이기도 하고 나한테 말을 먼저 많이 걸어 줘서 그분을 보고 아 나도 저렇게 먼저 말을 걸어 주면 대화가 되게 수월하게 되겠구나라고 생각을 하기도 하고 요즘에는 좀 사람들 만나는 걸 그렇게 무서워하지 않는 것 같아. 그럼 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 그 주로 아이에스티피랑 아이 아이엔티피 그 사이에 왔다 갔다 하다가 그 요새 에스가 잘 안 나온다고 했잖아. 뭐 그런 이유가 따로 있는 것 같아? 아 그 어떻게 해서 활발해졌냐라는 걸 묻고 싶은 것 같은데 뭐 아까 그 아르바이트할 때 그분에 대해서 얘기를 했으니까 내가 그분에 대해서 쪼금 더 얘기를 하면 일단 나는 어 철학과를 주로 나온다고 하면 사람들이 거기를 왜 갔냐. 이런 이제 되게 나에게 있어서는 공격적으로 받아들일 수 있는 그런 질문들 많이 들었는데 그분 같은 경우에는 이제 어 철학과 나오면 어 이런 쪽으로 직업을 많이 가진다라고 하더라고요. 이제 이런 식으로 나한테 추천을 먼저 해 주니까 되게 고마웠지. 어찌 보면 그 사람이 거의 최초로 왜라는 질문을 하는 게 아니라 그거 이러 이걸로 갈 수 있다. 이런 가능성을 제시해 준 사람이어서 나한테는 되게 큰 도움이 됐었지. 그거 그런 거에 있어서 좀 위로도 받은 것 같고 그 누나는 그러면 이제 그 뭔가 사고의 확장을 많이 했다라고 했잖아. 사고의 확장을 그러면 그렇게 사고의 확장이 일어나게 된 어떤 영향력이나 어떤 사건이 일어 있었던 거야? 나랑 잘 맞지 않는 성격 이것도 내가 되게 많이 고민을 했었는데 일단 첫 번째로 그 사람이 나랑 맞지 않는가에 대해서 먼저 고민을 하죠. 왜냐하면 그 사람이 마음에 들지 않는 이유는 여러 가지가 있을 수 있으니까 정확히 어떤 부분이 내가 마음에 안 드는지 먼저 생각을 한 다음에 그 사람이 하는 말을 일단 먼저 관찰을 해. 그러면 저 사람은 왜 저런 말을 했을까? 그렇게 생각을 하다 보면 그 말을 하게 된 이유를 이해를 하고 나면 괜찮은데 정말로 이해가 안 간다. 그러면 그때는 이제 그냥 아 저 사람은 이런 인생을 살아왔구나. 그렇게 다른 사람들하고 대화를 하다 보니까 이제 내 입장에서는 별로 좋지는 않지만 그런 말을 자주 하는구나라고 생각을 하고 좀 넘어가게 된 것 같아. 누나 같은 경우에는 그러면 마음에 안 드는 사람이 있으면 어떻게 대응을 하는 편이야? 아 내 성격 어 나는 일단 나도 잘 모르긴 하지만 개인적으로 생각을 해 봤을 때 최대한 내 감정을 안 드러내는 게 내 장점이라고 생각을 하거든. 물론 나 자신한테는 안 좋을 수도 있는데 감정을 가린다는 게 어느 측면에서 장점이냐면 상대방이 안 불편할 수가 있어. 그러니까 나만 불편하면 끝나니까 사실. 그런 것 같은 경우에는 나만 불편하면 끝나기도 하고 상대방이 안 불편해하면 상대방이 사실 마음대로 할 수가 있거든. 그러면 나는 그렇게 함으로써 이 사람이 그렇게 할 수도 있는데 그러면 누나 같은 경우에는 그런 그 누나의 성격에 대해서 그러면 어떻게 생각해 누난? 그러면 그렇게 누나의 성 누나의 성격을 고치려고 노력을 한다고 했잖아. 누나의 성격을 고칠 때 가장 영향을 많이 주는 사람이 있어?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3079494707697578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3971058658977073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3477761000394063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2407342077881836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26959027098464444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3682498027012464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3682498027012464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2984463341811053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3682498027012464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
