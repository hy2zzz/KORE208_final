SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35769489861643855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2504667494149772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35769489861643855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35769489861643855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28859251161849653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24499375961868552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33219126361830753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3140961466166275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2704973946168165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35769489861643855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37168822969526283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34518687063222975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34518687063222975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37168822969526283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34518687063222975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29988249807781553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37168822969526283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37168822969526283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5484109076181095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6312613981632037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5484109076181095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2671947272421471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.328135338236636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2474086483826026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28506890994371337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2754912626773378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28506890994371337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3102611555350698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3102611555350698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3102611555350698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3533275838279924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.328135338236636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31748845166384176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3357789997696469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3357789997696469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3615580794386483,0.0,0.0,0.3033012003519031,0.0,0.6715579995392938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24878404507859941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2026863883192529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29488170183794593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29488170183794593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3781965286772729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3051334713425935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33209887191792636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3781965286772729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33209887191792636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35123112810194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30423159642468117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3583722322664711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3726130822465801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3726130822465801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44418310984090786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3267019905338242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44418310984090786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36944957729908623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35532963289506964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35532963289506964,0.35532963289506964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3016486539400248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38673099258577237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35532963289506964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3433913900055463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22068846756385155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16663248116321241,0.0,0.2945944186255836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25370264349068483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3115660387186448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3354861937604824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3354861937604824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3354861937604824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3354861937604824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3354861937604824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3354861937604824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22795324695031285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4253424584266095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4253424584266095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4253424584266095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3734982738110019,0.0,0.2913271853147993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4253424584266095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17875782810310445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13497243763111053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27174407442858256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27174407442858256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27174407442858256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5434881488571651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27174407442858256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27174407442858256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27174407442858256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27174407442858256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27174407442858256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2523687304861934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3648306207009935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3169480858605946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3062993729977115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3449575731817022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3648306207009935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3648306207009935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39284010802210106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3648306207009935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.390604947812062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4367395213414926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5937898280414954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5514526320161973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23811608726160383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26361379881450114,0.26361379881450114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22901556009788218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28385247105472217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28385247105472217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28385247105472217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28385247105472217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28385247105472217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28385247105472217,0.28385247105472217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26361379881450114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28385247105472217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19441732138126322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33715336887504727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7260759285742059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33715336887504727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33715336887504727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36303796428710294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3187827836794292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3336942032871724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35291836670434995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35291836670434995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35291836670434995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3800133032494188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35291836670434995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3800133032494188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3145608275910975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32549675572619524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35426171017550057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4034357246017984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35426171017550057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35426171017550057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4034357246017984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3050876957492028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35894626166814364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3906672318006938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4448945884149104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35894626166814364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3732099221951014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3364398751864771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3732099221951014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4985451631664968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24762216465355294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40223218544627115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43777843986774156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40223218544627115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4182159244036258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43614476010969877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5405779757576038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47468795274419623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5405779757576038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3272156600738943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3766493558202181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4055662141038765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4055662141038765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3766493558202181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3402184228626971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4055662141038765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2660000261819631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3682242531732749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38943769694136837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4193363666689308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4193363666689308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33832558344571245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4193363666689308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4716116559926686,0.4716116559926686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41412780674187694,0.4379857597838475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4379857597838475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44380667819204267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30397376941833676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44380667819204267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3460382595525912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44380667819204267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44380667819204267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5924645723075576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3799287022802815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3799287022802815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33361991416952264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3528397977816458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3528397977816458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.33948196350791565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2620903729003029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2688629659893658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3655453343246235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30664599960214495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3655453343246235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3655453343246235,0.33948196350791565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3655453343246235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27920483342516716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27920483342516716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25929753760145713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20018556396888407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27920483342516716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27920483342516716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24517308643426117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21114133944335517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27920483342516716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27920483342516716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23421731095979006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25929753760145713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24517308643426117,0.27920483342516716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24517308643426117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3742171691099693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3019228765686583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3475354967463705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3019228765686583,0.2829919287545449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3742171691099693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3286045489322571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3475354967463705,0.3286045489322571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.37884112081812266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3291197648318977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35820489356884666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37884112081812266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4079262495550717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4079262495550717,0.0,0.0,0.37884112081812266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30456771215785655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23747294984464903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.245728863759355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30456771215785655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2554935373850103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2554935373850103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30456771215785655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2674445320373616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30456771215785655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2303213519168667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30456771215785655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2674445320373616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30456771215785655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40161758670711495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33690602715841744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40161758670711495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37298226543239954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35266518165651245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37298226543239954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40161758670711495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48340181988960174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5382713119064675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6903525731869997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4039835503443911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37517953593690434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2562611867468452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4039835503443911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4039835503443911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4039835503443911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37517953593690434,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40170523021858484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21528537706763934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3241005722124661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40170523021858484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40170523021858484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3241005722124661,0.0,0.40170523021858484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3132115525712348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3832656951152336,0.0,0.0,0.3365501672841182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29883415595314816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3832656951152336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35593886313263556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3832656951152336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3215111264077896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35593886313263556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37028709411418564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4216855444260254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3537404889251323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32879030226878864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4216855444260254,0.4216855444260254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31015476205897397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.614185559272912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.614185559272912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49553223665190627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29130167739869367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19951946031431503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29130167739869367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2271293570038976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29130167739869367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29130167739869367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.235025668647617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19951946031431503,0.0,0.0,0.29130167739869367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29130167739869367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.270531876980919,0.0,0.270531876980919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29130167739869367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.270531876980919,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.374663807870629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34795029017747153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.374663807870629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2623487962611983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.374663807870629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32899674774245946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.374663807870629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.374663807870629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3451773389879217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18460855577655955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3716779662689846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3451773389879217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32637484470411116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3451773389879217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3716779662689846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3451773389879217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32637484470411116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482478814706465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22908332063579429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17297107788201785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482478814706465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3234178184972754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482478814706465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482478814706465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2921356387168701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482478814706465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482478814706465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23594557526027768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5620656015806028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3026087985928616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3026087985928616,0.3026087985928616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3026087985928616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3026087985928616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2810328007903014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3026087985928616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3925556612564411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36456645498076035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36456645498076035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26887072665227785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3925556612564411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3925556612564411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36456645498076035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2582297242850148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32988294395791434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34209418879778125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48296556883542086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5200447425923687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5200447425923687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.35116515533461334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35116515533461334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17442005727737397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35116515533461334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3261270908266831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35116515533461334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35116515533461334,0.0,0.35116515533461334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35116515533461334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5166541293412994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3180625979563199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6403650093970625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4709961243532271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43962389776645894,0.0,0.43962389776645894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36878848372844936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40827872771103074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3427769249903084,0.0,0.43962389776645894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46656882047340237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5313318508823446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46656882047340237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5313318508823446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3618401487708481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3896200457537034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3896200457537034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3896200457537034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3618401487708481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3896200457537034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3618401487708481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2977793530787573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26440825258138034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3149344576309361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23745540151298006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2431389537951759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3149344576309361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3149344576309361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3149344576309361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33911321949320644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3149344576309361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33911321949320644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3861899144653755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4158392391080647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4158392391080647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2789651424224314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3861899144653755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32423190912950206,0.0,0.4158392391080647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34100156730601766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3606467088482668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2936681538761858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.325763611696036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34100156730601766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3883349807358496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34100156730601766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3027867029956554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2936681538761858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4903232155683006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4903232155683006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5279672649173295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4903232155683006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30037880644384685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2789618070112303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30037880644384685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14919500932523433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4684136787294387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30037880644384685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30037880644384685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30037880644384685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30037880644384685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26376620408692114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26376620408692114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6598279536939033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7514167096386106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5878114697962002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3886491483442557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3886491483442557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3609384763160949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3030316610320317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3609384763160949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40442316525212785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3058344218677077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40442316525212785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40442316525212785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3551287935599178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40442316525212785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3551287935599178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6298134723508707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4912520325760996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6016697021914846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23316292960200977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4694339496847803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4359633238670785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4359633238670785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4359633238670785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39379532230723885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5881186333877678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4745011298609938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40281646635944207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5164339698862161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32557686762449195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26267930103579296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30236324722384517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2858929214364398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2394656806351462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2858929214364398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30236324722384517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32557686762449195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2858929214364398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32557686762449195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2858929214364398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21416994596679456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34031664978380544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4500210795536311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39516886466871826,0.36308237587954545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30823016099463263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37751039563046607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39516886466871826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6235555075830732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4715475139640035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6235555075830732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3799607445549521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4709409098648952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3950594700541817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23391142095127218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41353881658600233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3950594700541817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30979286076198564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49607184310237484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5908670222210264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6362302166139783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야?

SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.295509452234521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46585657074928744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40907419791103194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3522918250727765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46585657074928744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43264101193694043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29733043431090717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18860730811319742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24942238261599492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22484835017910068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29733043431090717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29733043431090717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26108939224500394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27613078371529576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5946608686218143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29733043431090717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2821592665422531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19325760526309196,0.0,0.1789836948412796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23669570422972566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23669570422972566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20753151568490436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2620413197304076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24776740930859528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2821592665422531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2821592665422531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23669570422972566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20753151568490436,0.0,0.2620413197304076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2821592665422531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2821592665422531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2821592665422531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3367370465283799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26255553878154725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25464856812107306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29569280732472647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3367370465283799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3367370465283799,0.0,0.27168346651996006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27168346651996006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3367370465283799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28247951359179313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31272770572361347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야?

SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.5625936125454755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5625936125454755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6057861456372727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5088229217516621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5088229217516621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5088229217516621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47254386346698635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26355005395789743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.283783832253774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26355005395789743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.283783832253774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49838791958054196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.283783832253774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.283783832253774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.283783832253774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.283783832253774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.283783832253774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.221267656003517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야?

SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4108489347718691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44715667267202713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5092251605757764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47291742267561837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38508818476827794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35956237117578105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40947215459152897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33036701945845387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35956237117578105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40947215459152897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40947215459152897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35956237117578105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40226503954456705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31364803866836466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30420239584942016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40226503954456705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40226503954456705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40226503954456705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40226503954456705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5507454749198059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41648683455940766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5114773399154854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5114773399154854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5037702079845146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35275226718089303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3379535036664906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5037702079845146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5037702079845146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4037412909569384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6319637680689885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6615245768862035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39694109445246734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2779478992328125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3485586981630411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39694109445246734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30017630187361477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32025681063869627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39694109445246734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3686392069281225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47066178734205055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6036408941088748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5063778634098672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39708514495493563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29559200685169945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5515509542751196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5515509542751196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5515509542751196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8944271909999159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3392026845665385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3652446140361562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3652446140361562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3392026845665385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3652446140361562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3207256415592665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3652446140361562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3652446140361562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5910558023881303,0.0,0.0,0.5910558023881303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5489135423057507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6429971711608762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7658685513057126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2955639067115179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3125913791304853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3365902536043982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3365902536043982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3365902536043982,0.0,0.0,0.3365902536043982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3365902536043982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.271565032237605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2955639067115179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2955639067115179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27032516269697227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3322749548093304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4261547382968733,0.0,0.4261547382968733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3957699188871284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3957699188871284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3742115464302396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37652926009551907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7530585201910381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3560189644851774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40543689815618245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401211,50대,우리는 아파트 생활을 많이 했으니까 인제 전원주택을 계획을 하고 있잖아. 그 우리 뭐 몇 년 후에 시골로 내려가서 땅을 사서 집을 짓자. 뭐 그럼 집을 지으면 우리가 이제 여러 가지 생각을 많이 했었는데 뭐 컨테이너 하우스를 지을 것인가. 한옥 학교 가서 한옥을 배워서 한옥을 할 것인가. 아니면 컨테이너 하려고 보니까 또 복잡하다 그래서 다른 것도 찾아보고 있는데 그럼 당신은 어느 쪽이 오히려 좋은 거 같아? 그치 우리는 인제 우리가 집을 지을 생각을 해서 뭐 당신이 뭐 땅을 파거나 그럴 때 필요해서 뭐 포클레인을 배웠다거나 그런 것도 있긴 한데 그래서 인제 이제 앞으로 뭐 타일을 배우자 뭐 벽 뭐지? 페인트 칠하는 건 쉬우니까 벽지 벽지 바르는 것도 배워야 되냐 뭐 그런 얘기도 하긴 했었는데 그러면 구옥을 사서 하면 너무 일이 많지 않나? 그 부숴야 되는 것도 있잖아. 그러면 구옥을 바꿀 때는 인제 구조 변경하는 게 불법이니까 기존의 내력벽만 없애는 거는 불법이 아니고 기둥 세 기둥 내버려 두고 그 들보라고 그러나? 그거 내버려 두고 그러면은 전체적인 뼈다귀나 같 살려 놓고 어 인테리어 위주로 바꾸는 건데 그럼 만약에 바꾼다면 어떤 타입으로 하고 싶은 거야? 약간 한옥 느낌 나는 거 아니면 뭐 모더니즘 뭐 이런 거 아니면 약간 공장 느낌 나는 거 왜 그런 거. 그럼 어떤 스타일이 좋을까? 그럼 한옥 스타일이라고 하면 벽을 황토로 바르나? 아니면 그냥 그 벽돌 같은 거 싸서 회벽을 바르나? 어떻게 그 외벽 느낌은 어떤 느낌이야? 근데 내부랑 외부랑 너무 격차가 생기면 너무 산만하지 않나 재료가 너무 다양하게 쓰면? 그러니까 욕심을 좀 줄이고 1가지로 약간 통일성을 줘야 되는 거 아닌가? 그러니까 작업 시 공간은 뒤에 뭐 컨테이너를 따로 만들어서 약간 걔는 모더 컨테이너 박스만 하나 갖다 놓고서 걔를 모던하게 만들어서 내 작업 공간 작업실 이렇게 만들어 놓고 주거 공간 자체는 1가지로 딱 느낌 살려 주는 게. 부지가 넓으면 내 공간 당신 공간해서 2개를 만들어서 같이 쓰면 되지만 그래도 그것도 웃겨. 2개가 다시 쳐다보고 있으면 그것도 좀 낯설지 않을까? 그치. 그리고 공간이 잘 나와야지 세 그 가사를 도와주는 가전제품 같은 거 놓기도 훨씬 편안하지. 그 많은 실수들이 내 나는 좀 특이한 집을 짓겠어 그래서 뭐 8각형 뭐 3각형 이딴 거 지으면 제일 나쁜 게 가구가 안 들어가는 거야. 그리고 가구가 들어가고 가전이 들어가기 좋은 거는 딱 네모 박스 안에서. 근데 그 안에서 인제 다른 인테리어로 소소한 것들로 정리를 해 주고 변화를 주는 게 훨씬 활용도는 높고 사실 가 가사 활동하면서 가전제품 도움을 많이 받잖아 요즘에는. 뭐 냉장고 세탁기 그런 건 당연히 하지만 요즘 건조기 없어도 안 되고. 요즘은 빨래 널었다가 걷었다가 다시 접고 그런 것도 완전 일이라 거 세탁기 돌려서 물 빠지는 순간 바로 건조기 넣어서 건조기 돌려 갖고 꺼내서 인제 정리만 딱 하는 쪽으로 같 자꾸 상황이 바뀌고 또 스타일러 같은 것도 기본적으로 있어야지 밖에서 입었던 거 1번 빨기는 애매한데 그런 애들은 걸어줘야 되니까. 그런 거를 쓰기에 좋은. 그치 특이한 구조의 내부 구조가 좀 특이해지면 가구도 정말 만들어야 돼 가우디처럼. 가우디가 괜히 가구를 만 까 가구까지 만든 건 아니라고 하더라고. 그러니까 자기가 만든 공간이 워낙 특이해 갖고 거기에 들어가는 가구가 없으니까 자기가 가구 디자인까지 해서 했다 그러는 걸 보면 만약에 당신이 특이한 공간을 좀 만들고 내부 저기 하고 싶다면 가구까지 만드는 생각까진 해 줘야 돼. 뭐 가전은 뭐 다른 걸로 어 다른 위치 배치할 때 쪼끔 그런 공간에다 집어넣으면 되긴 하지만 음 가구도 뭐 소파라든가 또 뭐 기타 여러 가지 몇 가지 정도는 배워서 만들면은 뭐 당신이 원하는 공간도 만들 수 있지 않을까 싶기는 해. 근데 그러면은 꼭 필요한 거 꼭 필요한 시 디자인 그런 게 뭐가 있을까 재료가? 시설들? 우리가 인제 전원주택을 만든다. 음 그러면 일단 작업장 만 작업장은 기본적으로 만들어야 되는 거잖아 당신 저기 하는 거 있으니까. 작업장 만들어서 그 안에 인제 그 안에서 목공도 할 수 있고 또 작업하는 게 어 드릴 뭐 이런 거. 그런 거 그거 목공 하는 과정에서 필요한 거고. 그리고 막 용접도 하려나? 아 용접도 할까 근데 용접을 사실 작업장에서 하는 게 아니라 밖에서 인제 만약에 비닐하우스를 만들거나 그랬을 때 그때 용접을 하게 되는 거지? 그러면은 아 비 비닐하우스 같은 걸 만들어서 저 고거는 할 수 있겠네. 스마트 팜까지는 아니라도 작은 어 작은 비닐하우스도 만들어서 옆에서 이렇게 텃밭 같은 거는 가꿀 수 있겠네. 응. 그래. 그 전원생활 가면 제일 좋은 거는 층간 소음 같은 거 신경 안 써도 되는 거 그거 하나는 진짜 좋을 거 같아. 그리고 우리가 그 안에서 당신이 뭐 집에서 가끔 뭐 작업을 할 때도 지금 아파트에서 사니까 작업할 때도 뭘 빨리 만들고 싶을 때 내가 그러잖아 맨날 10시는 넘어서 드릴을 해라. 10시는 넘어서 망치질해라. 밑의 사람들한테 피해 준다. 물론 우리도 옆집 사람 때문에 시끄러워서 신경 쓰고 아랫집에서 뭐 해서 신경 쓰지만 신경 쓰는 만큼 그거 땜에 아 그러니까 우리가 이거 싫으니까 다른 사람한테 피해 주지 말자 뭐 이렇게 해 갖고 우리는 좀 조심하자는 쪽으로 하고 있는데 이제 전원주택 가서 작업장을 하나 만들어 놓으면 당신이 일하긴 뭐 작업하긴 너무 편할 거 같긴 하네. 그 작업장에 갖춰야 될 것들이 뭐 있을까? 음 그러고 보면 장비들 많이 사고 그래서 작업장 만들고 우리는 인테리어보다 사실 작업장에 더 신경을 많이 쓰는 거 같은데? 그리고 뭐 생활할 때 하는 거 있고 그래서 전원주택에서 편하게 살고 마당 마당 넓게 텃밭은 우리 쪼끄맣게 할 거니까 마당이 넓을 필요가 있나? 마당에는 어 연못을 만드나? 연못 할 거야? 아니면 저기 쪼끄맣게 그냥 큰 석재로 된 바가지 뭐라 그러나 다라 대야? 그렇게 큰 것 같은 거 놔서 쪼끄맣게 어항 정도만 놓나? 어항 정도 놀 연못 쪼끄만 연못? 그런 거 정도만 하나 마당에 그런 거 있는 게 이쁘지 않을까?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41864208369366107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42143235888319297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3700647688764193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39138424497681157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25860095105688286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39138424497681157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3700647688764193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28268108686638244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3625487953617989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3625487953617989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3625487953617989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3625487953617989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3625487953617989,0.3625487953617989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3625487953617989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2930837623359289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3829323397841902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4587549575785258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5468707713738186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5078789026102107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6885615079331783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6394670941184563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34200129434328913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18035851215955567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36312122543171593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36312122543171593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36312122543171593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36312122543171593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33723069350267343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3046124808431558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31886106875992243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36312122543171593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3530879192681635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30674656622165447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33385451998654236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38019587303305147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38019587303305147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3530879192681635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33385451998654236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38019587303305147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3920071701683865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4464205196424881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2217323997639891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4464205196424881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4464205196424881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4464205196424881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39452289493559617,0.0,0.4541249468325038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24287617148525778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4889899121582311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39452289493559617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4293878602613234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2434286192657415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19821956354099354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2301685795549071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26211759556882064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1404763521933497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26211759556882064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18354117539985232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19821956354099354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5242351911376413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26211759556882064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5242351911376413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3011737510193434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5289285087551089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3011737510193434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.210889254274268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20204196825488951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3011737510193434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3011737510193434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3011737510193434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3011737510193434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3011737510193434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3428477183322973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28784327630477513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2791747547755063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3691694914368897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3691694914368897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3428477183322973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3691694914368897,0.3691694914368897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2428459079740834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21100725910388946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.320769014321576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17190933302575803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.320769014321576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.320769014321576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.320769014321576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.320769014321576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.320769014321576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29789819370990134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26908436738706487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21100725910388946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.320769014321576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40049662950692716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37194123244525673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5373451506391856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3028650820950276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40049662950692716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40049662950692716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45300569884280545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3612360930810959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45300569884280545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47910341195163114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47910341195163114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3107243975775327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2477780471473371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35385512712070233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35385512712070233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35385512712070233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.328625267709202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35385512712070233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35385512712070233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.328625267709202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5549819857599185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27565374375461116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5549819857599185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5549819857599185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39008151583197004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39008151583197004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39008151583197004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39008151583197004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39008151583197004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29498892527923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39008151583197004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32281894488720875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41387252802574764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33003049506778154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47132094279714426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47132094279714426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41387252802574764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23696697060711203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.345975655292939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.345975655292939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.345975655292939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30380533960928185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.345975655292939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42459783457719863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.345975655292939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26975892767735826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3632648510704364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2959548336129681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2742858479260502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5522279598834433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37046131531252563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5128541237479379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39456416362354296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48455464156421446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32016181733364585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.521755814709163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48455464156421446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28151623728837916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3355887479729273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29468447269980397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3355887479729273,0.3355887479729273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3355887479729273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3355887479729273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31166128081897454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29468447269980397,0.0,0.0,0.29468447269980397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3995803248981792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4763301123900423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4763301123900423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4763301123900423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3995803248981792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37828298237860497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37828298237860497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3513114176570918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30520322322024857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37828298237860497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31733126474801265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3321747879417617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37828298237860497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3098761903779532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3974275066585325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3489858225089104,0.2782884970009108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3206492538096031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30054413835928834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36909093795922515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2438710009606737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3974275066585325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5298248808731012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3283447238210045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30493375536077894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30493375536077894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30493375536077894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5766468177935523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.578114224825852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.344293508365858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3255391580890322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.344293508365858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1841358634058243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.344293508365858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2274864914692639,0.0,0.0,0.344293508365858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3918035745681432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5595398998472004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46938274351918324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5595398998472004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4695277365979124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32272901490186023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6021864327024745,0.0,0.0,0.5592505590294787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3381490674905737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4937031726911745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45850215203799294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43352663041746486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4937031726911745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3737778335899892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3737778335899892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3737778335899892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3737778335899892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3471274858351187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3737778335899892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24587735304303757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3471274858351187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22592191048391866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3535518526798538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25718543033580443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22592191048391866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3298496867493843,0.0,0.28964493475144554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30633141447979617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3298496867493843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3298496867493843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30633141447979617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3298496867493843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3474361372033624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3226639515706655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3474361372033624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1725678930003648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3226639515706655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23307702203747063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3474361372033624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3226639515706655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3474361372033624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3474361372033624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32226767592631755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17235595592880903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32226767592631755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27056497309353167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34700943791306416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34700943791306416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34700943791306416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32226767592631755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32226767592631755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34700943791306416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36114127399798346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2371984213831696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4775587268480452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4775587268480452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4006109760191845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44350880467466547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39537338648929077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30936572949958885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48424061770492477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4245754677953998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5772516149637411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7514167096386106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6598279536939033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1896293978454453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3181298883293327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25075830520700315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25075830520700315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25075830520700315,0.22019385152622423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5015166104140063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25075830520700315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22019385152622423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25075830520700315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19551748940704572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25075830520700315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1896293978454453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25075830520700315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3814891097747862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3006997020129825,0.0,0.27925982273640004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3006997020129825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3006997020129825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27925982273640004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3006997020129825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3006997020129825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27925982273640004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3006997020129825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27925982273640004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27999089033688285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5224405233363645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5224405233363645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5224405233363645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3205819708848833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43691887467256424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40576657267847843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40576657267847843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43691887467256424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35251136066799826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40576657267847843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49616508019175576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5400124171620124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3054491301989499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30748496740417913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30748496740417913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21060378127270502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20226878934933482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30748496740417913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35068142326043006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3615702640866435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4637270400238067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4637270400238067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3615702640866435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4306633166850716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5240778341120008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3360744603386527,0.0,0.0,0.3360744603386527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2711488840772226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3360744603386527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3360744603386527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29511098250754375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3360744603386527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39235156316918085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39235156316918085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39235156316918085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34452857613325344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3643769090806893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39235156316918085,0.3643769090806893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3817326748771935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3817326748771935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3817326748771935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3817326748771935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3817326748771935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3817326748771935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35451514718925253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.330773192083233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.482934273882721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23986839933355017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.482934273882721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3652063905907677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.482934273882721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16822106221072938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.313886997079903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2915068640806639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.313886997079903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.313886997079903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.627773994159806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.313886997079903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.313886997079903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4366076126703271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3662582045221854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4366076126703271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38339033979427406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4366076126703271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38339033979427406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3870131472239792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48533124064154326,0.0,0.29620707753697945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5132912321237003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5132912321237003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38759743285912196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3480871082744881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35641865712968757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46166405966871377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37592477288053316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4971078324558117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3916544232472927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31599146123867994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27424604226726007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3285482013801691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3053748887210798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3916544232472927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3439164092727121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25763687474649916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36372947521326054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3786133229323309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5241150163753739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5543093458690928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5241150163753739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40124280373041155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4367016240392863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49731887773530997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3051667297255131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41718722703962147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36578398342153684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3199106544087734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2809173521905562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3199106544087734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3199106544087734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6398213088175468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3199106544087734,0.3199106544087734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47787192970295495,0.0,0.47787192970295495,0.3725991044503702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41962502757665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47787192970295495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5275034330586812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6007246158229682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6007246158229682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41466937596932296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3233197610606761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2222332353387124,0.0,0.0,0.41466937596932296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3233197610606761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.278180341455082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41466937596932296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3851034625315563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3585349099957326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45983408778793106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37099962799531117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45983408778793106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3585349099957326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4270479318209224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4034343422804373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3582228531656331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4034343422804373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4266762435412339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4266762435412339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4266762435412339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41107460349455754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44263442397367997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.345124247147172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44263442397367997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38868255451159534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41107460349455754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18408469108115652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41911738788443753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2687666617125159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2687666617125159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2687666617125159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2687666617125159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2687666617125159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2687666617125159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2687666617125159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1649216365715859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2687666617125159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22546101372853533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24960360720294525,0.0,0.2687666617125159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4658505386150324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36322596642907684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4658505386150324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4658505386150324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4658505386150324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28936110638596835,0.0,0.2188217547513181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1437226330203331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28936110638596835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2540914305686432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28936110638596835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28936110638596835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1941174729629032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26872966862024134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28936110638596835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28936110638596835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28936110638596835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2188217547513181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19819031698559111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28936110638596835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3288613750414096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3054135693654521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2486927979204815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2887770864809456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22524499224452402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3288613750414096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3288613750414096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3288613750414096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3288613750414096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3288613750414096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2486927979204815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41405162827011155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28459761520874216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42844642397833055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5310363021133991,0.0,0.5310363021133991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3249325935152366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3249325935152366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3017649098382746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3017649098382746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3017649098382746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23899180932108718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28532717667501123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3249325935152366,0.3249325935152366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3249325935152366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24572175983478584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24226237860707478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1899743228871234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26820407923251616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25359447107732813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26820407923251616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2887951654256057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1937378123013723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2887951654256057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2887951654256057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24226237860707478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25359447107732813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2887951654256057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1899743228871234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2887951654256057,0.0,0.2887951654256057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2576429065300931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31933452747503516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2489867087008867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21871982732987702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31933452747503516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2489867087008867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31933452747503516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31933452747503516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31933452747503516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2489867087008867,0.0,0.0,0.31933452747503516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2965659857303092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39868340639365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3014938796263941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2932364143883423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39868340639365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39868340639365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33444462341242853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35008864301002207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33444462341242853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2710746478805442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2710746478805442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29188611896346783,0.29188611896346783,0.29188611896346783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29188611896346783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29188611896346783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2710746478805442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2710746478805442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44146245870336664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29188611896346783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45451366769064067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32831895730831967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48940847665154996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45451366769064067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48940847665154996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33343882403920067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33343882403920067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31527574994696733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3590382391769597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2514073894544423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31527574994696733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3590382391769597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3590382391769597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3590382391769597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48468334969559346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6409258095666072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5952278195441206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25215796501424964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31621700419181525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33443430405495445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36011014612427444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33443430405495445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33443430405495445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36011014612427444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33443430405495445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36011014612427444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5243094191732182,0.0,0.0,0.24787462259443058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28228136178544627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4554959407911868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28228136178544627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28228136178544627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2621547095866091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28228136178544627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2621547095866091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4848590801769356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3075634222858906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4257605275465873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3476364904573504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45028864304128613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4067350430876987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36287552604062473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4213637790940706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4798520321475164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4798520321475164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4798520321475164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3474248847661331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4138148737155478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4455850755597644,0.4455850755597644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4138148737155478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3737891530068895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2878383336580923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4202486779091959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36902536452876444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4202486779091959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4202486779091959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33906164703852376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36902536452876444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48569917983914335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48569917983914335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48569917983914335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4510688436240553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2980366058429871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25522426805010784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16189786381489887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25522426805010784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25522426805010784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13678201987582103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38030166810933436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19899962269929367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3574285964803499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22411546663837154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25522426805010784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25522426805010784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25522426805010784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.156611700690141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25522426805010784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23702678578186073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23702678578186073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4548490918398718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42523381026930474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3071685872709276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42523381026930474,0.0,0.45788068896155687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35701183528030866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26824227194942424,0.0,0.35471281490719175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7094256298143835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3294218023835458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28618653090466206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3294218023835458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6375712436784127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3925015878710558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6629067903959515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5041202551943847,0.5041202551943847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.250391254513577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30934021721962623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39306505351230375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42289271687568475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21338273587934833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512223507200323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24777575099812138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2620501419856764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2821687661168944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24777575099812138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45531425373380674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22000838095757838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2821687661168944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2821687661168944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49555150199624276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3804414360245783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3191419325741724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3804414360245783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33407015177130805,0.0,0.0,0.3804414360245783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35331597362613376,0.3804414360245783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28769886751803775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40956450613091655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46641493719501304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3912627551649267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3344123241008302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3636660307902218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46641493719501304,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4072113228805138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2798959440444181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5222633611770369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45860567175898903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5222633611770369
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33816578591906954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33816578591906954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28707781363447704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2934909318592377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41913830622803044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33816578591906954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2571932656101087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30828123789470124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3892537582036621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31119102384164615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2890031136493276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2288847204517486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31119102384164615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2732605408363856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31119102384164615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2426371786860662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31119102384164615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31119102384164615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2610496527043446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2610496527043446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20470669568080568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2610496527043446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4710702867501311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5364581523057271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5364581523057271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45002009576306706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4992400417985279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26755708554597657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46364424255249365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46364424255249365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4992400417985279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18933526171345338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7065687965532641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3280952318137266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35328439827663205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35328439827663205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3280952318137266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3737695617498454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3737695617498454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2617226231736983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22935392147097672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3471198037769164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31354507942331683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3471198037769164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3471198037769164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3737695617498454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28026984212872835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33382706424396563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31564284193773817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33382706424396563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19264295377370588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1785381751591859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33382706424396563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3594562861152494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2205709540176594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3594562861152494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33382706424396563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20637302461146836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26458213424280536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19820547185936116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30130799343811876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16147961266404773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29931305356039795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27982474300209514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27982474300209514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21098325411154364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2527590483589566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30130799343811876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22161563337075818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30130799343811876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30130799343811876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23493133105467456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5246063917732955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5246063917732955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48720197257351394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4606631148048258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5088229217516621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5088229217516621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47254386346698635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5088229217516621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3524880770602909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24967436720923106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31839411325742056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.379549978570344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3524880770602909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.379549978570344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2329009231564844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.379549978570344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31839411325742056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4645606332709253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4314374747599423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4645606332709253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40793621979117595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4645606332709253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40445980996182734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4351521621507527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45550688899061786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45550688899061786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48174869596641917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33534550309092054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.464219305550743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.464219305550743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.464219305550743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49096303589848317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20332791589364632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29768250938194507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22444771626582943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15920725937013486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21954327260696826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32053677105611156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28146715266862316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22444771626582943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32053677105611156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24239753428113472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26888954485316274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29768250938194507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32053677105611156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29768250938194507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6411411767330738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4217534623386736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6411411767330738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3050920695164312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29301754777737954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44543941463738407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44543941463738407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33685188574147273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37366696203643485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4136795984123425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44114367304324836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44114367304324836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23642157195822658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44114367304324836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2706962837500806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37006338171007114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38737350838143003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4880933100075219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.525132173703826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42876057538461343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5496958157589078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2767433165313022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30637727087792704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23653254606765203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1638574121504454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30637727087792704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3298990637242683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2767433165313022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3298990637242683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30637727087792704,0.3298990637242683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21701315934341148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3298990637242683,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25202281650297115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25202281650297115,0.25202281650297115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18069647661810942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12517709522679552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19650343511165722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2213042339413859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23405359762913694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17647256327128816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2213042339413859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19650343511165722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25202281650297115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23405359762913694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25202281650297115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15464721363213232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23405359762913694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25202281650297115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2213042339413859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25202281650297115,0.25202281650297115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35799691507778936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5643650784632341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30245946425604714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5643650784632341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3786034834746057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4051968652981364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5374080951342287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5081344102901943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5374080951342287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28078567870282206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1966130255114072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24656124548273825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28078567870282206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13946330784256275,0.0,0.24656124548273825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24656124548273825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28078567870282206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28078567870282206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28078567870282206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28078567870282206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28078567870282206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28078567870282206,0.0,0.0,0.2607656686606376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24656124548273825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401212,50대,이게 보통 사람들이 노년에 생각하는 건 너무 막연하게 생각하지만 그래서 내가 보기에는 짓고 만들고 개조하고 그런 거보다는 이미 시골에 전원주택을 꿈꾸지 않고 방치된 그런 주택들이 있어서 고런 거를 쪼끔 활용하는 범위로도 좋갔 조 좋을 거 같고 국가적으로도 그런 거에 지원 사업들도 많아서 그런 새로운 거를 만들어 내는 거보다는 그래서 나도 구체적으로 굉장히 준비하는 것들 많잖아 당신이 생각하기에도 내가 준비하는 것들이 많잖아. 남들은 그냥 그냥 광범위하게만 얘기하는데 내가 생각 여태껏 준비했던 걸 보면 어때? 어 그렇게 그 철거를 하는 경우도 있지만 당신이 알다시피 철거는 불법이야. 그래서 불법을 하지 않는 그 범위 안에서는 내부적인 구조만 바꿔서 하는 것도 있고 그 가끔가다 티브이 보면 전후 이런 모습을 보면 그게 더 새로운 거 어 내가 내 돈 주고 지었어. 내가 지었어 했지만 그거는 빈 땅에다가 업자들 불러서 지은 집이고 그 바뀌어지는 그런 개선하는 집들은 전후의 그 모습이 확실하게 보여서 더 재밌는 거 같기도 하고 내가 배운 거에 충분히 할 수 있을 거 같아. 기초 공사부터 해서 안에 인테리어부터 다 할 수 있는 준비도 다 돼 있는 거 같아 나 스스로는. 그래서 그런 거 보면 좀 더 배울 것도 있지만 지금을 활용할 수 있는 것들을 몇 가지 또 어 실습으로 통해서 좀 배워 봤으면 하는데 시간이 요즘 또 없다고 하지만 그래도 또 시간 내서 한번 해 보고 싶어. 어 당신은 대부분 한옥 스타일 좋아하고 나는 좀 모던한 적인 거나 그다음에 작업실 개념이 있어서 공간이 허락된다 그러면 고걸 같이 병행할 수 있는 공간을 만들어서 어디 보니깐 부인이 좋아하는 공간 남편이 좋아하는 공간 그다음에 같이 쓸 수 있는 그런 공간을 같이 만드는 그 경우가 있더라고. 그 공간이 뭐 허락을 해야 되겠지만. 그래서 같이 존재했으면 좋겠어. 근데 쪼끔 외형은 한옥적인 게 좋지. 사람들도 보기에도 아 이거는 뭐 이렇다 하는 거보다 아 한옥을 살렸다는 거. 근데 시골에도 한옥은 그렇게 많지 않을 거 같아 그래서 많이들 그 집들이 바뀌고 그래서 그런 옛날 모습을 그대로 갖춰지지 않는 거 같아서 보면 쪼금 안타까워. 그런 것들을 다 허물고 새로 집 짓고 있다가 빈집이 된 집들이 많다 보니까 슬레이트라든지 그런 것들이 있어서 좀 안 좋아 보여. 그래서 당신은 한옥이 좋은 거 같아. 한번 얘기해 봐. 음 목조 같은 경우를 쓰면 좋은데 목조 같은 경우에는 견고성이나 여러 가지 외부의 병충해나 이런 거에도 약해서 이왕이면은 내부에는 황토가 돼 있으면 좋겠고 외벽 같은 경우는 벽돌이나 유리벽돌 같은 경우. 뭐 그래서 그 외부에서 빛이 들어올 수 있는 거. 그 어디 보니깐 병으로도 집을 지어서 하더라고. 병 그거는 인제 그거는 그런 거를 하는 사람들이라서 그런 거를 활용했을지 몰라도 여러 가지 소재를 같이 썼으면 좋겠어. 하나에 딱 국한돼서 나는 다 목조로만 할 거야 벽돌로만 지을 거야 그거보다는 뭐 황토 내벽은 황토가 좋지 사람이 쓰기도 좋고 온도 조절도 잘되고 곰팡이도 안 나고 얼마나 좋아. 그런 천연 소재 쓰는 것 괜찮은 거 같아. 그래서 당신도 그쪽 분야에 대해서 또 잘 아니까 새 생각해 본 생각해 본 게 있어? 어 그 당신은 원래 좀 심플한 걸 좋아하는 스타일이라 그런데. 어 그래 그래서 공간이 분리된 게 있더라고. 그러니까 아래층은 그 부인이 쓰는 공간이 돼 갖고 2층이 그렇게 돼 있는데 그 공간이 그것도 허락이 되어야 하는 거고 작업실 같은 경우에는 맞아. 바깥에 따로 있는 게 제일 좋은 거고 안에 이것 이쪽도 존재하고 이쪽도 존재한다는 건 쉽지 않지. 그르 그리고 당신 스타일도 그렇고. 아주 심플한 걸 좋아하잖아. 그래서 그러 그렇게 보면 결국은 안주인 그 서 성향대로 가더라고. 결국은 남자가 그 생 생각을 해서 진행을 했지만 결국은 안주인 스타일로 가서 어 그래 맞아. 나중에는 결국은 심플한 거가 최상인 거더라고. 아무리 뭐 복잡하고 멋이 있는 인테리어가 있더라도 결국은 모든 분야들이 결국은 원 원 상태가 제일 충실한 게 최상인 거 같아. 그치? 결국은 딱 정형화가 된 각진 형태가 딱 편하네. 그런 것들이 인제 배치하기는 되게 편안하네 원이나 뭐 이런 것들은 좀 애매한 상황이 되더라고 얘기를 들어 보면. 근데 요즘들은 가전들 들도 굉장히 그 거기에 맞춰놓은 커스텀화된 것들이 많기도 하고 그래서 아 그러면 또 비용이 비싸지긴 할 거야. 나한테 맞춰진 가전이나 이런 것들 안의 가구들은 다 맞춰서 만들어야 되는 거니까 비용 면에 보면 어느 정도 평범한 구조 형태로 하는 것도 그게 맞는 거지 현실적으로 봤을 땐. 근데 사람들은 좀 특히 내 서 서 성격상 특이한 걸 좋아하다 보니까 그렇게 구상을 하게 됐던 거고 거기도 어느 정도 양보를 해야 되는 것들이 생기더라고. 나만 내 고집만 가지고 이런 형태를 고집하거나 이런 스타일로 꾸미겠다 이거는 내 고집인 거 같아서 어떻게 보면 당신의 의견을 수렴하는 게 나 나중에라도 편해질 거 같고 그게 내가 후회가 없어지는 경우가 되더라고. 뭐 시설들은 몇 가지 필요하지. 그 큰 장비들을 운용하려면 먼지나 소음 때문에 따로 분리된 공간이 필요한데 가구 아까 얘기했듯이 가구도 만들어 봤잖아 둘이서 만들어 보면서 아 변형되는 가구. 그러니까 트랜스포머 같은 가구들이 굉장히 필요해. 침대가 늘 쓰는 게 아니라 저녁때만 필요하듯이 다른 소파들도 맨날 필요한 소파가 아니고 사실상 소파를 우리는 별로 안 좋아하는 스타일인 거 같아. 소파에 앉아 있는 시간조차도 없으니까. 그래서 소파보다는 다른 공간으로 활용할 수 있는 트랜스포머 같은 그런 가구들을 난 많이 그런 정보들도 많이 수집해 보고 그런 것들도 봤는데 그런 게 있 그런 게 보면 내 성향에 맞는 특이한 성향 나만의 성향 나만의 것만 생각을 해 본 것들이 많은데 그런 공간 필요해. 그런 특이한 공간들을 쓰 쓸 수 있는 공간들 필요해. 그래서 당신의 의견도 여러 가지 방향으로 한번 생각을 해 보고 그럴 테니까 한번 생각을 해 봐. 그렇지. 요즘은 다 키워서 먹는 걸 좋아하기도 하고 키우는 자체도 좋고. 그러니까 고런 거 과정들을 보니까 그것도 흥미진진하더라고. 그래서 농사는 사실상 힘든 거야. 근데 그 안에서 내가 먹을 수 있는 거를 키우는 건 좋은 거고 아이 용접은 그 비닐하우스에서만 하는 게 아니라 집 외벽도 해야 되는 경우도 있고 다 여러 가지가 필요해. 전기 시설도 해야 되고 그래서 그 이미 다 준비된 과정 아니야? 다 준비를 해 왔고 그래서 용접이 됐든 뭐가 됐든 내 집에서 꾸밀 수 있는 건 내가 다 하려고 준비를 지금 했던 것들이고 그래서 고런 공간은 아예 작업장과 같이 병행할 수 있는 그런 거가 필요하지. 그래서 당신도 그런 거에 관심 있어서 나한테 그런 것도 많이 찾아서 정보를 주기도 해서 참 좋은 거 같아. 일단 공구들은 다 갖춰져 있지. 당연히 내 남자들은 공구 부심처럼 장비가 아니 그래도 지금 가지고 있는 게 없는 것도 아니야. 사실상 남들에 비하면 어마어마하게 많은데 그래도 갖고 싶은 장비들이 많지. 뭐 목공 같은 경우에는 큰 장비들도 있지. 근데 공간이 허락이 되고 많이 안 쓰는 거 같은 경우는 요즘은 지역 사회에서 그런 장비들도 대여하니까 다 갖춰지는 것도 좋지만 어느 정도는 대여용품을 쓰는 것도 괜찮을 거 같아. 그래서 지금 갖추고 있는 걸로도 충분히 많아. 더 근데 더 갖고 싶은 거지. 그러니까 뭐 요즘은 장비들이 장비로 일하는 거지 사람 힘과 그런 걸로 하는 게 아니더라고. 그러니까 너무 혼자 아까도 오면서도 얘기했듯이 목공 할 때도 재료들이 공구들을 많다 보니까 혼자서도 충분히 작업할 수 있는 그런 공구들이 많이 개발되고 그래서 건축 박람회 같은 데 가 보면 새로운 장비들을 많이 봤잖아. 어 이쁘지. 그랬더니 수영장이 든 연못을 만들었더니 그거는 한 여름철이나 그럴 때만 살짝 좋고 겨울에는 다 방치되는 그런 공간이 되더라고. 그래서 어디에 보니까 수영장을 만들어,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28459761520874216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42844642397833055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41405162827011155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5310363021133991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5310363021133991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
