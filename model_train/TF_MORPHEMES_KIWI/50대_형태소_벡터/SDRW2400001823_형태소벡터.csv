SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어? 집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6413517998292124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42111250006578954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6413517998292124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5358628148748112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3722272570666089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5358628148748112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5358628148748112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어? 집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6307161305792107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7760136355935945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34468021422103073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4784772868195487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37688824840203305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5050793423506821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5050793423506821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37485471854066366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6093370187405972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37485471854066366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5896408038525834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어? 집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7319442135415565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6813645634042268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43113691470823945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43113691470823945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43113691470823945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26571564477708387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43113691470823945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43113691470823945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3827045355173968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45382857040904423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4790602233300936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4342573799266265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4790602233300936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20542082239039067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28513134522090805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32923475947435743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34753933023576805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3733381737278069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34753933023576805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3733381737278069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3733381737278069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32923475947435743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37018378767920124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3976635943392043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.276229708140341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3976635943392043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27080493030514147,0.0,0.35068655456977416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37018378767920124,0.37018378767920124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3102842963453915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3582416202063384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.563920303628504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49730292424690425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4583342554123537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26352324849908154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42235744325184343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3892615040698791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47893532498129254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47893532498129254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3766790119579798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30470749922219537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2762105343174146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3273268127771563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30470749922219537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30470749922219537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26603952729737046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3273268127771563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3273268127771563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24999086892750666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3273268127771563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28865884085233146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43581076121394285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5953005137980504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6750453900901041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7319442135415565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6813645634042268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4756729773616999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3537394839074852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4756729773616999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44280247667378003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4756729773616999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3310382278708213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.291931816780486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26905603275485396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.291931816780486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3310382278708213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3310382278708213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2603590633026958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27934236436029236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27934236436029236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3310382278708213,0.0,0.0,0.30816244384518926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5373124393029945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36590439695472016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5373124393029945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5373124393029945,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어? 집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3544732918967871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5398606873789618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5398606873789618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5398606873789618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어? 집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36171879615520447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23586010383257144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2723144765436678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36171879615520447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36171879615520447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3990377487610773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3990377487610773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3990377487610773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5542887340921573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27714436704607864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27714436704607864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20610148154831934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27714436704607864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5159856370435557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27714436704607864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27714436704607864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40019994457689084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2609518816412125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47426204310299974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47426204310299974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47426204310299974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3114011291628041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.442470386300702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3485262382486601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4233890133379666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5017425444806574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5017425444806574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2776261282741153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3996738974790903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3996738974790903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3996738974790903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3996738974790903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3996738974790903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3524593753454323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30566342586524414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36223033715303476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30566342586524414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.284891421415492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36223033715303476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33719908014824496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36223033715303476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36223033715303476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30566342586524414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6813645634042268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7319442135415565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6072258597528222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5123997565328189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6072258597528222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42870928419031346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3886153795207196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4605336066890267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35172552938670565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4605336066890267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34248092304043953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20711346462114882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6638952265399417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33194761326997085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3764144342151925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3764144342151925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3504030114359558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4606748886049491,0.4606748886049491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38873459845410063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4606748886049491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4606748886049491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46730112449287975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29686235960189195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46730112449287975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46730112449287975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3943260626534132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31822739182371435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2737841128846008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2737841128846008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4306582695072313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5475682257692016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2737841128846008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2737841128846008,0.2737841128846008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25486476850470835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2737841128846008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4248046833269612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5226665543229514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5226665543229514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5226665543229514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4601363719916882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3421855150532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2531795530107699,0.0,0.0,0.4601363719916882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2923108076753361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31334826703241214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4601363719916882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5665354954221754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.359902972952971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4780637142820125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5665354954221754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3631730447470434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.522828262439635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.356040817381822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4411819260984637,0.522828262439635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48786468339193556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48786468339193556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.466825698032988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5532177410873468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어? 집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5967396311604329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8024349273321235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30749550702894385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.387113561740578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4762925631187165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4762925631187165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35420024572569714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42002687775545894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31348787646458276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.459371451992043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4164099489798392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.401076324848679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33604943863365805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4934719153456828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23606579347645038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3783504701759882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32766764572027157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3487029184387608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.429033294631705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3783504701759882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3783504701759882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3190553667015334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6813645634042268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7319442135415565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27638319679741985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5023073938692819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5023073938692819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5023073938692819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40825748581108584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3160310259449725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26479261497096773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3888348077901772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3888348077901772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3888348077901772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3429007356515121,0.32811326731749296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3888348077901772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27808295301244734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29061564605324125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2591852379161003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.181325037207747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3067730975509132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3067730975509132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32954574640741785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32954574640741785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29061564605324125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3067730975509132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3067730975509132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2450703483402318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5324609330827621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5324609330827621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4327652041083901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4956662058223175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어? 집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3239294151484149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5017477260116936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5017477260116936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.442474955723934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.442474955723934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5238360470275963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48763732655438186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5238360470275963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46195392564616106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어? 집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5191192193947642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38736475025676564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5191192193947642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5576549312688401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어? 집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32929001615024944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20545529891960776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2451755154002422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3734008324412937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3734008324412937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3734008324412937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3734008324412937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3734008324412937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30348684274378873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46169170637045837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46169170637045837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3031474282618025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3207056595498732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4071508583770144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46169170637045837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4582646813839268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3604217070554955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3008972388022102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4582646813839268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38670077599181585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4582646813839268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4208918330083568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4208918330083568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2594014591974973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3551641770459555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4208918330083568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3130008784922823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4208918330083568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44797713656477633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38788414754306405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5695886117190258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5695886117190258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어? 집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4234130666741231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48495476591364367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5209543521994228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.321071374015314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4594126529599023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3649821937021664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5653360799015957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47705160287263204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5653360799015957,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어? 집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5088313473466773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35345034489211324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5088313473466773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5088313473466773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3135997984178895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34937400970396376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26070153243982497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375309046726749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375309046726749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2791027340491091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375309046726749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34937400970396376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33097280809467955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2791027340491091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6019020686580199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46154327955536145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5091612412382128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40675119085657313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5001888357146208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5671928041342756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5001888357146208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42179921786461555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어? 집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41602830426247545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41602830426247545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41602830426247545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41602830426247545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41602830426247545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3668817933101146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5534166513469997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4115544290934929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5534166513469997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46699354590537534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어? 집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45447693498312447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4007883867908563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42307114757248704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42307114757248704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38350453475405105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3574426731497018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40941027502652566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2997232481285055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4321723897000685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3917546072249564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4321723897000685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4642537884755358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2316698509304738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33404586972564365,0.0,0.0,0.24926373377476055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3588430548567984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3588430548567984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3588430548567984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3588430548567984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3588430548567984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3588430548567984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3876967367610087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34576689975696867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43963156227390554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43963156227390554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3876967367610087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43963156227390554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3562911121104156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5518741026271791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5137378642167764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5518741026271791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어? 집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4780278678451672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4173652053891905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43332157276459426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38187982265853904,0.0,0.0,0.5135132505758186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3611264079760402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33617143595378834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2508498230589898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2508498230589898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.293510629506389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30473188938267115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3611264079760402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24592347183755364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3611264079760402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3611264079760402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34434287351765624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5420418143334218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5420418143334218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5420418143334218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31491959626745436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3975686875027561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5047320730409424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5047320730409424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4829656876959949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4897421022578294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26946943142854135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4897421022578294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4558993807341966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4897421022578294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29379011325104765,0.0,0.0,0.3331454568027602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3331454568027602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3331454568027602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3331454568027602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2150794261476226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22686872395462773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21874377874534467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23141336951858515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3331454568027602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27076871307029765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29379011325104765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4098414617013519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3947497115102485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4856878458099287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4856878458099287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4521252861741939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47331492143382514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47331492143382514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3223227273903713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47331492143382514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47331492143382514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26603289067111774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4834964265011651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42637972992785905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42637972992785905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3595574786069539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4500853008407126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40559704334768926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40559704334768926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6032534771430379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40559704334768926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37756901037780133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5033452106488905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27695423183042767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4438837253256061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46856247149758784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5033452106488905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2849998086896161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.311631112724863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37856888481336487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.311631112724863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44862788013783755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37856888481336487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3055110991881238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37856888481336487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3946335208825888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4474975795790937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3637100289092113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3946335208825888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4474975795790937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3946335208825888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44152566499102397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40023314212261174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44152566499102397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47430138427751256,0.47430138427751256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3492649930401124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5409910549589183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5409910549589183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5409910549589183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어? 집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3895974366323639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36267502687121805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25152494620115534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3895974366323639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31665086339414844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3895974366323639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34357327315529435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36267502687121805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5081241852303294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48136176067877445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4606032114743797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5458437041129375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는? 우리는 무선 청소기 쓰지. 왜 청소기에 투자를 안 해? 해. 괜찮아. 얼마나 좋은데 가볍고 요즘은 굉장히 가볍게 잘 나오는데 음 그러 그 지금 아까 인제 말한 대로 요즘은 가전 전자 제품들이 다 너무 비싸. 그래서 어 내가 본격적으로 사용해서 나의 시간 대비 얘를 투자했을 때 좋으냐? 나는 본격적인 가사 생활을 안 하 가사를 안 하기 때문에 사실은 그다지 그렇게 필요성을 느끼진 못하는데 너무 비싸다라는 생각에는 음 동의해. 어 최근에 우리도 청소기를 새로 샀는데 그 먼지떨이 그 통 자체도 옵션이야. 그냥 내가 돈을 더 비용을 들여서 그걸 사야 되는 거기 때문에 어 근데 그 세탁기가 처음 나왔을 때 여성들의 그 가사 생활의 가사의 노동 가사 노동의 해방이다라고 얘기했던 것처럼 그런 부분들이 사실은 어 내가 어떤 가 공동 그 같은 생활자와 이게 나눠지지 않는다라고 했을 때는 그런 가전의 도움을 받아야 되는데 어 말 그대로 그 가전들이 너무 비싸기 때문에 가성비 좋은 것들도 많이 나오기는 하더라고 보니까. 그런데 말대로 돈을 들인 만큼 그것의 질이 확실히 다르기 때문에 그런 부분에 대해서는 앞으로 쪼금 더 이렇게 음 전향적으로 좀 생각을 해 봐야 되겠다라고 생각을 하지. 올인원 다 해 주는 거. 자 무조건 그런 것들이 생기면 좋겠지. 아 나는 근데 요즘 우리 집이 되게 오래되다 보니까 어 가장 걱 저 바꾸고 싶은 공간이 다시 생겼는데 그때 바꿨을 때 같이 바꿨어야 되는데 그 욕실 화장실 너무 덥거든. 그래서 이 내년쯤에 아마 그 화장실을 다시 개선을 해야 될 거 같은데 어 만약에 개선을 한다고 하면 음 난 샤워 어 시설을 다시 바꾸고 싶은데 너희 집 화장실도 마찬가지잖아. 너는 혹시 바꾼다고 그러면 어떻게 바꾸고 싶어? 집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41318324686967123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3337950818234952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5083678980514532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4483130695375464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5083678980514532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6449098581622922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7642586439452892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24864517834546943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19695524733159875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33321692488388105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33321692488388105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2661954014419427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35795257505661354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35795257505661354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33321692488388105,0.35795257505661354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33321692488388105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.446101100402473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6098094109614953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6550773164463084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3217992405286495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4028204573710927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2841265200805681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4327229778370735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3816042814606112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4327229778370735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3651477369230112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36130087398603256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36130087398603256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7226017479720651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29365242923991536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36130087398603256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2706815760128308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2706815760128308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35299788289993606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2385476254626011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5657614049010566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3207746502961358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2986081118021722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2385476254626011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3207746502961358,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,올 여름에 많이 더웠지. 아직도 더운 중이고. 어저께는 괜찮았는데 오늘 보니까 어 다시 더워지더라고. 근데 우리가 작년에 지붕을 새로 고쳤어 우리 집. 근데 우리가 노후 주택이다 보니까 정부의 지원을 받아서 50프로 지원을 받아서 지붕을 고쳤는데 그것이 너무너무 다행이다 좋았다. 이런 평이었었는데 그 주변에 노후 주택들이 굉장히 많은데 무조건 어 부수고 그냥 아파트를 짓는다 이런 건지 아니면 그런 주택 정책에 대해서 한번 생각해 본 적이 있을까? 아 우리 공동 주택이 아니고 우리는 단독 주택이다 보니까 그런 부분들이 생각보다 많거든. 근데 아까 말한 대로 어 그런 노후 주택은 어 정부 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있는 기회가 생각보다 많은데 그것을 이제 도시 재생이라고 이야기를 하더라고. 그래서 보면 지붕이라든가 혹은 그 새시 창문을 다시 새롭게 개량을 한다거나 창문만 고쳐도 벌레가 들어오는 경우는 굉장히 적거든. 진짜로 벌레가 많아 방역을 단체로 하는 것이 아니기 때문에. 그래서 그런 부분들을 활용하면은 굉장히 좋을 거 같아. 너희 집도 마찬가지잖아. 근데 앞으로 혹시 지금 현재 집이 아니라 다른 형태의 집에서 살고 싶다 그러면은 어느 형 어떤 형태의 집에서 살고 싶은 다는 생각을 했을까? 그거 그때 한참 도시 재생이라는 부분에 대해서 어 굉장히 관심들이 많았고 그 부분으로 흘러가는 과정이었었기 때문에 지원받는 건 많이 어렵진 않았었거든. 근데 그때 인제 아 우리도 그런 집단 주거 형태로 좀 이사를 가서 아파트로 이사를 가서 살아 봤으면 좋겠다라는 생각을 했었는데 그때 마침 그런 기사들이 많이 났지. 주차라든가 혹은 층간 소음 때문에 칼부림이 나는 그리고 나는 약간 이해가 안 되는 게 그 특히 집값이 그 땅에서 그냥 위로 올라갔을 뿐인데 그것을 난 땅을 갖고 있지도 않은데 그 집이 그렇게 비싸다라는 개념 아직까지 한번도 아파트 생활을 해 보지 않았다라는 것에 대한 두려움 그 야 진짜 두려움이 있어 그 사람들과 같이 이렇게 공동생활한다는 것에 대해서. 음 만약에 그런 부분들이 만약에 집단 생활할 때 생긴다. 이러면은 어떻게 가능 해결이 가능할까? 근데 그거는 우리 동네도 요즘은 마찬가지야. 그러니까 예전에 구세대 그러니까 예전 사람들이 처음부터 살던 사람들이 다 이사를 가고 집들도 새로 짓기는 했으나 원룸 형태로 바뀌면서 인제는 우리도 아는 사람이 거의 없어. 근데 음 그렇기 때문에 그런 사람들 관계는 굉장히 뭐 변화가 되는 거니까. 근데 집의 내부에 있어서도 우리 집이 오래된 집이다 보니까 요즘 다른 집들을 가 보면 굉장히 발전적인 그 그 특히 로봇 청소기를 사용하는데 너무 부럽거든. 근데 우리 집에서는 사용할 수가 없어. 그런 로봇 청소기 사용에 대해서 너희 집은 어때? 어 수건을 말리거나 속옷을 말리거나 할 때는 정말 좋다고 하더라고. 그러니까 그런 용도로 많이들 사용하신다라고 하는데 우리도 건조기 사용 안 하니까 우리는 옥상에서 말리기 때문에 굳이 건조기 사용이 음 그서 저기 뭐지? 그 바 그다지 그렇게 그거에 대한 필요성은 많이 느끼지는 않고 있거든. 그래서 그렇지만 이게 지금 발전된 생활 가전 그러니까 그런 전자 제품 같은 것들을 사용해 보고 싶다라고 하는 욕구는 있지. 그래서 지금은 식기세척기를 사고 싶어. 식기세척기 설거지 하기 너무 싫거든. 세탁소도 기업화 되어 있고 프랜차이즈화 되어 있다 보니까 그 그거 뭐더라 세탁 그런 프랜차이즈 세탁소를 많이 이용을 하고 그러네. 동네에 보니까 세탁소가 많이 없어졌네. 근데 내가 이용하는 세탁소는 아직까지 있기 때문에 괜찮고 난 세탁소 그렇게 많이 활용을 안 하 안 해서 빨래라든가 이런 부분들은 다 집에서 해결을 하는 편이거든. 그 요즘은 나의 가장 큰 이슈는 작은 세탁기를 하나 더 갖고 싶다. 그러니까 큰 세탁기밖에 없기 때문에 건조기 이런 거 말고 작은 세탁기. 팔목이 아파서 요즘 세탁하기가 너무 힘들어서 그냥 속옷이라든가 양말 이런 것들은 그냥 작은 세탁기로 매일매일 돌렸으면 하는 생각을 가지고 있거든. 음 그런 필요로 하는 요즘 그런 그 가정 생활에 필요로 하는 게 가장 필요한 게 뭐가 있어 너는?

집 자체가 오래돼서 사실은 막 돈을 투자를 많이 하진 않겠지만 그 지금의 인제 그 어 세면대와 그다음에 욕실을 좀 불 그러니까 화장실을 분리하고 싶다라는 생각 따로따로 어 그런 생각 정도 그냥 고 정도에서 수순이 되지 않을까라고 생각을 하지. 어 우리 집에 좀 있다 와 봐. 나중에 와 봐. 엄마가 옥상에다가 굉장히 많이 뭔가를 해서 그 저기 깻잎도 따고 고추도 따고 하시더라고. 너는 그런 것에 대한 생활에 대한 뭔가 이렇게 희 희망 같은 거 그런 그런 건 없어 혹시?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4170032735692722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6159734383822454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.668344965597905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8212979358092015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5704995185234994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6462736645252215,0.28496383368728756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32313683226261075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28496383368728756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28496383368728756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26263406098064135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32313683226261075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24679083511196442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6938110399654714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44792590528709403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5639048006488049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5282736788335508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40346097798300046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5282736788335508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5282736788335508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36152543513409524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482128446213533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28130795680358056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42843032295186806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3778187291166727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39882443845654875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42843032295186806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6482251396197963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3995101209353662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6482251396197963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29666390714011126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8541618236378226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4270809118189113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.5145017268350169,0.5145017268350169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5145017268350169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45372229309496875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5426246347684699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5426246347684699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47852296840962455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42677017256271643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41889959203959004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41889959203959004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34046660738161005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41889959203959004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38995231106374334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31151932640576335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3294613619182026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37673908409365625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44645945148221183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4156076974295209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44645945148221183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39371802957113866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3628662755184477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3928540685071606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21615899876070213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2495683824488978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2536274347703452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3928540685071606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3928540685071606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3464451905948888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33150486894273096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3657066152279353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3406822817021134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36597210677077824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36597210677077824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36597210677077824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3406822817021134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3406822817021134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36597210677077824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3406822817021134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46719473168745546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30676072247846037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41200379693010164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46719473168745546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.394236284448614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37971916971730174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4243604675179988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4243604675179988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4243604675179988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4243604675179988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3155803670058193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4243604675179988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44878592544963586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31174089599638305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31174089599638305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44878592544963586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44878592544963586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44878592544963586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6048800044253758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5630808912786676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5630808912786676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43417384855418845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3528809768262819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43417384855418845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38288375702778427,0.4041710683526861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43417384855418845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3945358373947832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3800076921098178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4675497207227936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3570839796429331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4675497207227936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3677243202930802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41345289897525417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5256921470242695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5256921470242695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5256921470242695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25832035658486713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40663084829411544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40663084829411544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35859448337735206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40663084829411544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40663084829411544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3785313761468516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3842716817499845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4056361579718419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23976023981322164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35416014373462323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4357476959872031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26855733306372714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35416014373462323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34271226828765883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.473491745594903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.473491745594903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30079507512818615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38483715742233837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41755692812620776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3723976779284631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3209455917050478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39488153762303796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3332157227620598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39488153762303796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3209455917050478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39488153762303796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24337095433147468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39488153762303796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45330296495770367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45330296495770367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42197830257279756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45330296495770367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45330296495770367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4778219903071644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4778219903071644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30848290852372307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36492926911820356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4778219903071644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29448830269859355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3661968092168925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3661968092168925,0.33194921883223044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3661968092168925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33194921883223044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39338065100499037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31972572473782757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3469095665259255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5779622726661503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5093495086822725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6375913184632505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42197830257279756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45330296495770367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45330296495770367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45330296495770367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45330296495770367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24265744857892935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4410131730547708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30634169638132025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4410131730547708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38891513424922536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41053777399241115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37214331186918825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.4666935233109204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2964763688325158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4666935233109204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.379311805473476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.379311805473476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4344435311753055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39192232478230893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5075309728741466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5755184744941512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5075309728741466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21297700765069336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3066042495724384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3066042495724384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28541693039280264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28541693039280264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27038428820138377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28541693039280264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3066042495724384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3066042495724384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3066042495724384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27038428820138377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3066042495724384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42197830257279756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45330296495770367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45330296495770367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45330296495770367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45330296495770367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3528809768262819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4041710683526861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43417384855418845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43417384855418845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38288375702778427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43417384855418845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25103242738997295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34290051165547414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36196486163402003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38883455378822473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38883455378822473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38883455378822473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38883455378822473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2891611273470647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4606032114743797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48136176067877445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5458437041129375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5081241852303294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38538183967402634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38538183967402634,0.35875074093813064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38538183967402634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38538183967402634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38538183967402634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35875074093813064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5420914020963489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5823324051263542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3965625433897579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4580000337262179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3734200322774453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3734200322774453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34761553210184387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34761553210184387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30350244768397255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3734200322774453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3734200322774453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32930694785957404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6550773164463084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.446101100402473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6098094109614953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4055473340555529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3296143696065026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37752273615429216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4055473340555529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4055473340555529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4055473340555529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30158977170524187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46636608542644575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39353704192530314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4341387202797899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3175906395717537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4112730408177311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4112730408177311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41517701345973085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33744102864178566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28839508289696497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38648697438660645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35034179983933106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41517701345973085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3012958540945104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3087509895686612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5615756983276444,0.5227690491028314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4952352932983113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4075380480638289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30964433155037474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37721826396573616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44647764749243257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4047220035262071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44647764749243257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44647764749243257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28751433397186565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2676461880767022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28751433397186565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28751433397186565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23368136833070213,0.0,0.0,0.23368136833070213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28751433397186565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2676461880767022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28751433397186565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28751433397186565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28751433397186565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25354951422586564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21381322243553869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2426152845118432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.549819786906932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5906344901568211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5906344901568211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3476922519394603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4277898018043143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28088738971097527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4277898018043143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4277898018043143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3609849395758293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3476922519394603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34643537282162495,0.42624337657996286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3758901324356848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42624337657996286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29608212867734696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3255368882914068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42624337657996286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4014008913405112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35398235490817354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2788257528238384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4014008913405112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3736628256885138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4014008913405112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2985062236041786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29129845937982646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4472135954999579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6446610117332162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7644685604726372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5639111447178934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6220905191583105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5431460271752885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.753286269437685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.657692782594317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43236461792466263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4644602863538053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4095923787707134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3774967103415706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34540104191242793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4095923787707134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34637463869506946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31398086450836404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34637463869506946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32813141114539685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3720870237861135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3720870237861135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3720870237861135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3720870237861135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4106329685868467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42913944980757285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4529984537537444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4529984537537444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4866258311288466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6130718470724879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4982828721261208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6130718470724879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40345424939653296,0.45749990946553204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45749990946553204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45749990946553204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45749990946553204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6614168524704116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7500184979506398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43629224227448754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43629224227448754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4021043719135305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.304913129398546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43629224227448754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4174772995046681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37187673251064596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3461788792089696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3279459621279369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2583173384435515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2765502555245841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3461788792089696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3461788792089696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22919277469787264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3279459621279369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30224810882626046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30730844455932077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2708263370343183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27813676720910446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36417978751495383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3211582773620291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3211582773620291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36417978751495383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30730844455932077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30730844455932077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30730844455932077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5949212861817729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6279973161786354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5016851942406276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5578313358430281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5578313358430281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45338536015494085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41483745816926904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48118559903648106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33424673386069226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31065446158114585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48118559903648106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44793415883091575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3578390061402386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.3542438687652176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40169743689951964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40169743689951964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3739388790155366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40169743689951964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2987267529972514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40169743689951964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3311086232782726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2533242755083532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2533242755083532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3460310868588457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39238449253409197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29180107865737714,0.3086074366328028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39238449253409197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39238449253409197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7642586439452892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6449098581622922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.33670074085379137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35542040018203924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26521332558866134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35542040018203924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3818042781504803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3818042781504803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35542040018203924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3818042781504803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.3666367006619067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4157503796538401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2684093426780398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28879336118723575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4157503796538401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3666367006619067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30917737969643166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3666367006619067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666270317980325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38383946653171175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3119709912175518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38383946653171175,0.38383946653171175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38383946653171175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35731495063707114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3384955071121924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7642586439452892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6449098581622922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34193567623241794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31780069222647633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4922546925123138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4341033590837013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37595202565508884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4582383430896429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45160266558930273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5120981596563509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35571957603043225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.380827474605658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5120981596563509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3155667154352007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3578391947981309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33311137955830783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3155667154352007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2814378211539606,0.0,0.0,0.2661110849555545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3578391947981309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2908389001953776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3155667154352007,0.0,0.0,0.3155667154352007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4073297739778984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4375670339777216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.369235331591838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4375670339777216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38587609658849403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4073297739778984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38046655014744496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5116128250543313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4511746648323348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4511746648323348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4317179230535704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2888540333565989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4165000167644724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4474180102463863,0.0,0.0,0.4474180102463863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4474180102463863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3775479516171595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4954777906056108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5369809626471865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6827541320058658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3744788122638523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.511523461986562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5800457868479169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.511523461986562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24199002286532287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3242981497100573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3483717335644423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3483717335644423,0.3483717335644423,0.0,0.3242981497100573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3242981497100573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3483717335644423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2147063186849335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30721767014207507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.383958998823515,0.0,0.0,0.3386009187419443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.357426222871089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3386009187419443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27864079835196526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31206814278951833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30198084953300536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3386009187419443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3386009187419443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24111645291992637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37347528905687477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37347528905687477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37347528905687477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37347528905687477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23017798721135285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30354735841815494,0.0,0.0,0.31515233435819984,0.37347528905687477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7760136355935945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6307161305792107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3673645910395359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26894222053082545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33857789304969615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6771557860993923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3515221279234523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3097911950598565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5286175686339587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4920884299601499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5286175686339587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4460671579060698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5835695557648279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5835695557648279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5647062485654668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7610861901848133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6486507620514804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42344253050190045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42344253050190045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3734201576253728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3941813181720408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42344253050190045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2609734893484921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3148977329656533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4632119454765343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4632119454765343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4632119454765343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4632119454765343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3764821035207073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5032279878910468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47672344146395607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5405840479709445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47672344146395607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4396315622739056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38769673676100874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4396315622739056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38769673676100874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4396315622739056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3457668997569687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4267992681035386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4267992681035386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4267992681035386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3601490904120245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3763803550406513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4267992681035386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21195907452674353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3250637985235939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3852209959439451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26758668581655704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33971383284406637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2623316452491078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3852209959439451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3852209959439451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3852209959439451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6291116169174812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6291116169174812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4565491725093199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.412020189503575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.412020189503575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27053303994100353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3064033824305996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2539337425773587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29900493253753396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.412020189503575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.412020189503575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4607195189220035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43645385371067386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40225331947377807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4949200531588992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43645385371067386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714091787121469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.336674115223094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3989799496709361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32427663444683186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3989799496709361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.336674115223094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2967058634880427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3518474054056211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3214284588333254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3760922297770654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46273225687090414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46273225687090414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3760922297770654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4307560007208055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3649821937021664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5653360799015957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5653360799015957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47705160287263204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.640410710366744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5647573193147948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5205029224970109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35616587573696634,0.4167372698192738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4167372698192738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5127406580561346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5127406580561346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6614168524704116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7500184979506398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31348411286317657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31348411286317657,0.0,0.31348411286317657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31348411286317657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2645295494717307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31348411286317657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31348411286317657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21347954538495786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31348411286317657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31348411286317657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31348411286317657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37148261844197134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34581199966355364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37148261844197134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37148261844197134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37148261844197134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37148261844197134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37148261844197134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.228949876745271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333364379942935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5342493555912473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5639521887588967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5342493555912473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5808746768403097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6131697529820593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5353573235079409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482845915327298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482845915327298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482845915327298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482845915327298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482845915327298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2659970533199326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2830732603607584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482845915327298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482845915327298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4180608258661208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26990097174076627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3397848882324529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4180608258661208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36867420782433596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38917150627423786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4180608258661208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3816375418689907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33320699850488306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3048769467473304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3615370502624358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2526686993432359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34594589770286893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4099675936265434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4099675936265434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32158402789640367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38134907246212346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4025510594358741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.432433581718734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38134907246212346,0.364903533718887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35146655017926354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5324609330827621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5324609330827621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4956662058223175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4327652041083901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.392233764592945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3084888902467163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2158176906675119,0.33098143343761294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.392233764592945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.392233764592945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36512917626760466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.392233764592945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4020345975152821,0.0,0.2999966590384676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43187878134519647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4020345975152821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4020345975152821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3396693961738557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35101562827687477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41410470345022526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33656949341488285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38548876437559265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3005176738251457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41410470345022526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36518543248951546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41410470345022526
SD2401348,50대,나는 기본적으로 어 살고 있는 것을 무조건 부수고 새로운 것을 만드는 것이 좋다라고는 생각하지 않아. 그래서 고쳐서 살 수 있으면 내 어 경험이라든가 추억이 있는 집인데 그것을 부수고 아파트를 지어서 돈을 많이 번다. 이런 투자의 개념보다는 어 내 아이가 살았고 내가 살았고 20년 30년 보낸 집은 국가에서 조금 지원을 해 주고 여러 부분의 지원을 받아서 이렇게 고쳐 가면서 어 개량해서 사는 것도 좋은 방법일 거 같아. 근데 문제는 그런 노후화된 주택이 너무 인제 가다 보면 불편하거나 또는 환경이 좋지 않아서 발생하는 것도 많잖아. 아 맞아. 요새 벌레들도 많이 들어오고 하는데 너만의 주변 환경을 깔끔하게 하는 방법 알려 줄 수 있겠어? 나는 개인적으로는 그냥 아파트에서 살기를 원하지. 그게 제일 간편하고 그다음에 뭐 여러 가지로 신경 쓸 필요가 없으니까. 그런데 지금 살고 있는 연립 주택도 그렇게 크게 불편하지는 않으니까 근데 다만 네가 이 쪼금 전에 얘기한 대로 그런 새시라든가 어 이런 것들을 지원을 받아서 고칠 수 있으면 어 지원을 받아서 고치면 좋을 거 같기는 해. 근데 알아봤더니 생각보다 이런 기준이 되게 차이가 많고 그다음에 뭐 주택의 형태라든가 그 가구원 수 수입 정도 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 너무 규제가 많아서 이거를 해야 되나 하고 고민이 되는 게 조끔 있어. 어 너는 그것을 했을 때 좀 신청하거나 할 때 좀 불편하거나 했던 점은 없었어? 글쎄 나는 그런 다가구 주택들이 사는 집에서 만 오래 살았잖아. 근데 1번도 부딪혀 본 적이 없어 생각보다. 뭐 층간 소음 이것 때문에 층간 소음 있을 때 서로 그냥 어 대화를 통해서 이야기해서 잘 넘어갔고 심지어는 윗집에서 물이 보일러가 터져서 물이 줄줄 새는데도 윗집 아저씨하고 아주머니하고 내려와서 사과하고 상태 보고 그다음에 천장 다 보수해 주고 어 이러면서 하는 부분이 있었고 서로 연락하기가 너무 어려워서 그 부분이 제일 어 불편했던 거 같아. 왜냐하면 바로 옆집하고도 누가 사는지 모르 모르고 마주친 적도 없고 심지어는 우리 옆에 지금 어 몇 달째 사람이 살고 있지 않다는 데도 난 모르고 있었어. 우리 집도 불편하지. 일단은 로봇 청소기를 사용하려면 문턱이 없어야 되잖아. 그런데 우리 집은 곳곳에 문턱이 있고 이러다 보니까 나도 로봇 청소기 정말 사용하고 싶은데 어 정말 밀대 밀기 싫거든. 어 그래서 사용하고 싶은데 그렇게 주거 환경이 열악할 때는 사용할 수 없다는 게 쪼끔 안타깝긴 해서 발 달린 로봇 청소기 나오면 안 될까 문턱을 넘는. 요런 생각도 좀 했었어. 아 그러고 보니 어 저기 건조기 요새 많이 쓰잖아. 그치? 건조기 나는 솔직히 건조기에 대해서 그다지 어 건조시키는 것이 정말 위생적일까 막 이렇게 생각이 들거든. 나는 햇볕에 말리는 게 더 위생적일 거라고 생각하는데 너는 어때? 나는 어 그 옷 스타일러. 스타일러 갖고 싶어. 그 스타일러가 있으면 옷 냄새 이렇게 딱 걸어 놓고 특히 겨울에 어 오버코트 같은 거 입고 와 가지고 그거 걸어 놓으면 그 속에 막 왜냐하면 이거를 자주 빨 수가 없으니까 그 스타일러에 넣어 놓고 음식물 냄새라든가 여런 잡다한 냄새 여름에는 또 그 땀 냄새 이런 것들을 또 해 줄 수 있고 세탁소가 없어 주변에. 그러다 보니까 스타일러가 있어야 되지 않을까 이런 생각을 하는데 맞아. 요새 주변에 세탁소가 많지 않은 것에 대해서 너는 어떻게 생각해? 난 가전 제품 청 청소기. 좋은 청소기를 가졌으면 좋겠는데 내가 왜 청소기를 망설이냐면 값이 너무 비싸. 무슨 청소기 하나에 100만 원이 넘을 일이야? 그래서 너무 갖고 싶고 청소기가 편하긴 한데 그 무선 청소기 갖고는 싶은데 내가 마음에 드는 청소기는 다 100만 원이 넘는 거야. 그래서 내가 이 100만 원을 주고 이 청소기를 가져야 할까? 아니면 그 돈을 아껴서 내가 밀대를 밀며 다녀야 할까? 요새 그 사이에서 어 고민 중이거든. 그래서 옛날처럼 그냥 유선 줄 있는 청소기로 이렇게 그냥 값싸게 가성비 있게 타협을 할까 하는데 유선 청소기가 무선 청소기를 한번 사용해 봤더니 유선 청소기로 돌아갈 수가 없는 거야. 너는 그 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 아 먼지 너무 많아. 며칠 청소 안 하면 이 청소기가 정말 필요한데 청소는 너무 하기 싫거든. 밀대 미는 거 내가 왜 이거 밀고 있어야 되나 막 이런 생각이 들어서 어 청소기가 좋은 게 있어야 되고 네 말대로 정말 투자를 해야 되겠다. 이런 생각은 하는데 하면서 막상 사려고 하면 너무 비싸니까 이게 잘 안 되더라고. 그래서 주변에 어 좋은 가성비 좋은 청소기 있으면 소개해 달라 해서 샀는데 생각보다 이게 청소기가 성능이 별로 안 좋더라고. 그래서 그런 비싼 청소기를 사는 거 아닌가 이런 생각도 들고 막 먼지떨이도 자동으로 해 준다 하고 이러니까 쪼끔 어 고민이 되고 있기는 해. 맞아. 네 얘기를 들으니까 옛날에 엄마가 청소기가 살 수가 없으니까 짤순이를 샀던 기억이 나네. 어 짤순이 하나만으로도 우리 엄마가 되게 행복해했던 그런 모습을 보니까 아 정말 여자들이 가사일을 할 때 정 이 가전제품의 도움은 정말 지대하구나 이런 생각을 많이 하게 돼. 만약에 앞으로 가전제품이 새로 생긴다면 어떤 부분에서 이렇게 가전제품이 새로 생겼으면 좋을 거 같아? 나는 바꾼다면 바닥에다가 온돌을 놓고 싶어. 그래서 그 온돌 작동을 하면 이게 건식도 되고 그다음에 습식일 때는 물 그냥 쓰고 그리고 또 말리고 어 우리 전주에 갔을 때 그 게스트 하우스에 화장실의 온돌이 깔려서 되게 겨울에는 따뜻하고 빨리 말랐던 이런 기억에서 오히려 그게 곰팡이도 안 슬고 그런 부분이 있지 않을까? 그리고 어 저기 뭐지? 수납공간이 좀 있는 화장실이 있으면 좋겠다. 그러려면 건식으로 써야 되겠지. 그래서 그 온돌을 놓고 싶은 게 건식과 습식을 다 쓸 수 있어서 그걸 놓고 싶다 이런 생각을 했었던 적은 있어. 너는 어떤 걸 저기 샤워기 말고 다른 건 어때? 아직은. 지금은 바쁘기도 하고 그런 걸 그러니까 식물을 키우는 게 관심이 많지가 않아서 그런데 어 나중에 내가 여유가 생기고 지금 일을 안 하고 정말 힘이 쪼끔 달고 주변에서만 일을 할 때는 어 텃밭이나 이런 거를 가꿀 수 있는 여유가 생기면 한번 가꾸고는 싶어.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35061727287568867,0.35061727287568867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35061727287568867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3263885151834194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2849691803330665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3263885151834194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21609027562669506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2677786031749831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35061727287568867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30919793802533585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
