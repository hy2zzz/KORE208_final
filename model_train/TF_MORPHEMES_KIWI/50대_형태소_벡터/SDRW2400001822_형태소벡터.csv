SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33785915161726615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28299288401037315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41581769290652293,0.41581769290652293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33785915161726615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41581769290652293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41581769290652293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6180629946508539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7861285738625831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3221370996420565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2536395754223127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36535422571827436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23972676835808898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34007382757474847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3221370996420565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36535422571827436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36535422571827436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2440284141110201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30822429257783274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49989102051253487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3816285139525685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3715806356536816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49989102051253487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4653014547230998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4732686939059715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37794311694387694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5084505280863147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38816304252281214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4732686939059715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47337543431005535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48738805707689226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3622868917968557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3197991309110157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42973575794356556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4536636240035373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3720834588102389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49914772999103246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3924354756062596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49914772999103246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44010439927473627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3924354756062596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47337543431005535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32511794239335495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2866602974094191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24166773704612005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24166773704612005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32511794239335495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32511794239335495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32511794239335495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32511794239335495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3026216622117054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32511794239335495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2742797010258861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38454177140842344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4242773694815566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4242773694815566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4558172880347538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2767060776184318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4558172880347538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41765400377709455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3887547636466019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41765400377709455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41765400377709455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3887547636466019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41765400377709455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4938598563045683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3428519378007831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38827809072717645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4938598563045683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4938598563045683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29861385997432544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4017281119591995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35420838113148156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4017281119591995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4017281119591995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4017281119591995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3739308513806214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5497822591861715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.590651956520991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.590651956520991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3274708091281642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4159070858494438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47170416412797794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.286350282181886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47170416412797794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4390649656852325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45751305490749256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45751305490749256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45751305490749256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40339461865133375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45751305490749256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3401318251304561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3401318251304561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31659667114755813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29989821365299685,0.3401318251304561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3401318251304561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3401318251304561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3401318251304561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3401318251304561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4055831186267518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3014793761952601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4055831186267518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3295433809266123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37751911389539955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4055831186267518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4055831186267518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3256565859692687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2871352257585974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30312303476925395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2560348159881579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3256565859692687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3256565859692687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30312303476925395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24206812335856792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24861386554792608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24861386554792608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3256565859692687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24861386554792608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27101127248998225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3447054863130678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30393086428189114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28007923941257407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3447054863130678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2631562422507145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3447054863130678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3447054863130678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3447054863130678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30393086428189114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34653598579680606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25845929083365005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37229676766725717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37229676766725717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37229676766725717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37229676766725717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34653598579680606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37229676766725717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45515303770484694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5214153323243312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5601762898884667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45515303770484694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40200615436302756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5408227648981965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5034009592660602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5408227648981965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33714727545563283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2847736091646817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3622101196542208,0.3622101196542208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3622101196542208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27651968935248394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31936490450335236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31936490450335236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3622101196542208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6000391252797407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6000391252797407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5290615240849095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6072647395959004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6072647395959004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5123075951877409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5384431838456585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4110601384442266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5384431838456585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5011860314519093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4025633966074615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4025633966074615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3164998025978375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29923474650322274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4025633966074615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4025633966074615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4025633966074615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4360805776563977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2813309020484404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3678912630361096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40590632524659154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3678912630361096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.324148847634133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4360805776563977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.514612365206785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3825233539556785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45373974925770416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.514612365206785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34372132720361076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37939117507249637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5086785405635691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5464926708782231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5464926708782231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6250084877797237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5269107310686143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5759596094241689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31326054234868145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27933042734375724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35528681119021005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28867675103116125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35528681119021005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35528681119021005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35528681119021005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35528681119021005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33070301987268985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45751305490749256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45751305490749256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45751305490749256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45751305490749256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40339461865133375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7319774557880256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6813288517434801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.356543072863659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.356543072863659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.356543072863659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.356543072863659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.356543072863659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.356543072863659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33187235550822364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.356543072863659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4151719628662305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47087041884176895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4382889107480107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4382889107480107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47087041884176895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4355825793861111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.595314440502152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6751803710601725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40734201211959326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48317902823441244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5480011459097553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5480011459097553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47337543431005535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39463070210531576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3479505117423806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3479505117423806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3673245412164736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39463070210531576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39463070210531576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39463070210531576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3399473076227969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3588757153568224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3252652939453483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28659112297921985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3399473076227969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38555380767861097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28659112297921985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3399473076227969,0.3252652939453483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3537674670149793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4052698017996508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.296317785918744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4052698017996508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4353967363482704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32364053246635976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4052698017996508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5011860314519093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4110601384442266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5384431838456585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5384431838456585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35960990396812076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35960990396812076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33472697964776715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35960990396812076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33472697964776715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35960990396812076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35960990396812076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35960990396812076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3535759007627959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3442666183313331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37631358661031633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46314520901580336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4310982407368201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46314520901580336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3841209045314348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3841209045314348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3841209045314348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3841209045314348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3841209045314348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33868390013656396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3841209045314348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5185625386493403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4699966850504731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4912116682863605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5185625386493403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4066436512381848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44127353614206083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44127353614206083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5004737154034382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44127353614206083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36233147165945745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3856322089480815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3527916642342101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4746140356644484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41847275366195286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44177349095057694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4303006257016729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4303006257016729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4303006257016729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4880287061130506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4542599438337791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3219854852548508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23933930871490125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24581126127474456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3219854852548508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3219854852548508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3219854852548508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3219854852548508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2997059529799026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28389837326479767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2997059529799026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3219854852548508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44008105373715206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6349522289675019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6349522289675019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47087041884176895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4382889107480107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4382889107480107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47087041884176895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4151719628662305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47564812128010836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6219963282539148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6219963282539148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8025647272625017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5965650497255655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44875318585026397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43422415808571907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5522997187777606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5522997187777606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42992664635190353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31957448719943565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3790713591511391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3626996134276474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42992664635190353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2609890390261186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42992664635190353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5630607357305941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6049175280623336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5630607357305941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6150541697404112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37875540921956974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5188790029527837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4571840860819356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29989821365299685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3401318251304561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3401318251304561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31659667114755813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3401318251304561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3401318251304561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3401318251304561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3401318251304561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3401318251304561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31284142460246633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32130094121782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37108476669111573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4208685921644115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3917469211200868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3917469211200868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4208685921644115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3565736628653449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2650495065284816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3565736628653449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3565736628653449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3565736628653449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33190082885881483,0.0,0.0,0.3565736628653449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3565736628653449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23816367606456665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4412831973522544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3619293452198579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47408729463510413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47408729463510413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47408729463510413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33803351702117845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3631622426190735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23828850108847166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3631622426190735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3631622426190735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33803351702117845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3631622426190735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2699469512764095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33803351702117845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40390061601641164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40390061601641164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40390061601641164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4339257680727425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3660733980360365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4339257680727425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3687983476852197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5716606150489794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5040398592610594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5321050086426231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40135252829583673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40135252829583673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40135252829583673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40135252829583673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26334701450778075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40135252829583673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3538772246168669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18730623090555484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26980459516526706,0.26980459516526706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5396091903305341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23788987135913964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23788987135913964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2511356785178097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1637861775131218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5022713570356194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26980459516526706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.413685716021891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4444382725532351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3494222940174178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.413685716021891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37494207678294567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4444382725532351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3799622560418748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3799622560418748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30343042170041507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2678451452396653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30343042170041507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4082078790019057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3799622560418748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3799622560418748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32462862637785284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32462862637785284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6492572527557057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28622886174795287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32462862637785284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32462862637785284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.273866898676526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43126635632813676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3802525971271249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4014252201747259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43126635632813676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4014252201747259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4014252201747259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6813288517434801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7319774557880256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45721440693149185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3857204247625693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34904818753509675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45721440693149185,0.0,0.3857204247625693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4031312972332943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6448179797509891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7643361649103443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5393520270791702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5393520270791702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47555299886779817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43823295978169435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26803248718373945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3860864443543923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35937149665696627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3860864443543923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3860864443543923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3860864443543923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2947474348811656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3404169396177789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.590651956520991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5497822591861715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.590651956520991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3753518690082175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.330952138817658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3049799616140437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3753518690082175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3049799616140437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3753518690082175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3753518690082175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3753518690082175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3358242476767254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3043727060939148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26169562342983943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3043727060939148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36078874067538647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36078874067538647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3358242476767254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36078874067538647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36078874067538647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3316302178280297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3316302178280297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3316302178280297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3316302178280297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25317427602863707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3086833258723266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3316302178280297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20422061184634166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3316302178280297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24650846301692717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27977366099029727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48401712635734445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39788197858198143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5025516877805315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5957005570094805,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29738804503166855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46097015834821886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38888889454348685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4290736909885852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38888889454348685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46097015834821886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5399757365165248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43121405569595395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43121405569595395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5801164368589553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23922509298312025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23922509298312025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2266074933339146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25700860087511174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25700860087511174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23922509298312025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5140172017502235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3820809550998634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25700860087511174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1910404775499317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25700860087511174,0.25700860087511174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5497822591861715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.590651956520991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.590651956520991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4652563959363044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6259139262072545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6259139262072545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3940784201279243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3098288200806678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32019561208287506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36681047395590527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3940784201279243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30084869638186396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3940784201279243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33245692457867193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6125126040769161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40189946309032737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37182872307610343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5701302764370753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3375444988089586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4541018766523298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4541018766523298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.297958440691881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4541018766523298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42268065463984555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4176540037770946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38875476364660194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4176540037770946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38875476364660194,0.4176540037770946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4176540037770946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49092126164182975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4328510257874051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3988821154045335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49092126164182975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41415658538913036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.529190115280528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44613146216186966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6001849679559229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4008772188568983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40601654152618327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3620397679287249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4604867285479956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4604867285479956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3741535247111549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3741535247111549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4968122032341862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4706085245018257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5337442141151527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4968122032341862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4331090558722947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5423486974680574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5423486974680574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47342615731580845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36110913512285586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25069250953266986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36110913512285586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36110913512285586,0.36110913512285586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36110913512285586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2934074911075986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3361224726825274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2934074911075986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4311618797271846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4311618797271846,0.0,0.4311618797271846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2655130267060427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4311618797271846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4311618797271846
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4261095079906834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4577856240022241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.295333590038562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40363494601433675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4577856240022241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3862023214128371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5855880363762319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6291194625175828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5111705718589606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5594397375683702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5256371711555312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6408843455172265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5117965792065732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31068857563819363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5117965792065732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4763832176520427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3907174963222108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6222334051730695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6222334051730695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47502755601486263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4366179851491055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4366179851491055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4366179851491055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4064065472507389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26887294123633027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4366179851491055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35713922617174665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.332427258457284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3148938383323601,0.0,0.0,0.26546990290343486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35713922617174665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35713922617174665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35713922617174665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3148938383323601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.332427258457284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30011069620390923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3758052226698635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3406092721999124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3082259623461997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3559838912760724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3758052226698635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40374182020594507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3559838912760724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47337543431005535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5175862226633892,0.0,0.0,0.5175862226633892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48177225128585854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48177225128585854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401347,50대,나는 우리 집이 강아지를 키웠었으니까 달순이 달구 키웠었을 때 보면 지식이 많지 않아서 제대로 잘 케어를 하지 못했다라고 하는 생각을 지금도 가지고 있거든. 그래서 혹시 반려동물을 갖고 싶을 때는 어 그 반려동물에 대한 공부를 확실하게 하고 제도를 확실하게 습득하고 난 이후에 반려동물을 들이는 게 좋다라고 생각을 하고 있어. 너무 과하다는 생각이 들거든. 왜냐하면 누구나 다 뭐 지도사가 될 필요는 없지. 근데 지식을 습득하는 방법은 내가 어딘가 센터에 가서 그걸 하지 않더라도 뭐 나오는 책자라든가 유튜브라든가 이런 부분들 그다음에 기본적으로 동물병원에 가서도 충분히 습득할 수 있거든. 그래서 지도사라는 부분까지는 너무 과하고 여기서 내가 말하는 부분은 음 사회성을 키워 준다라거나 아니면 뭐 예방 접종이라든가 이런 부분들에 대해서 쪼금 더 정확하게 알고 거기에 가장 중요한 부분은 마음가짐 이 아이랑 이 친구들이랑 끝까지 가겠다라는 그 생각이 훨씬 더 커야 된다라는 생각이거든. 어 동물에 따라서 다른 거 같아. 강아지와 개와 고양이 개는 어떻게 보면 집단 생활을 하고 어딘가 소속되어 있는 것이 좋은 반면에 고양이 같은 경우에는 거기도 집단생활을 하지만 영역 동물이기도 하기 때문에 그래서 고양이는 자기들의 그 무리를 이루고 영역이 확실하다고 하면 그냥 보조해 주는 역할 먹이를 좀 보조해 준다거나 근데 개 같은 경우 강아지는 누군가와 함께 했다가 버려지는 경우기 때문에 반드시 나 내 생각에는 구조를 해서 어 다시 입양을 시키든가 이러한 과정들이 필요하다고 생각해. 음 근데 요즘도 되 강아지들도 굉장히 빈부 격차가 심하니까 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 보고 있는지 궁금하네. 그 반려동물을 키울 때 하는 말이 있어. 마음으로 낳고 지갑으로 키운다라는. 그래서 지금 현재 상황이 어 그 반려동물을 키우는 것이 굉장히 많은 비용이 소요되는 거는 그거는 우리가 뭐 딱 봐도 아니까 더더군다나 뭐 병원에 한번 가게 되면 기본적으로 어 4 5만 원 뭐 쪼금이라도 병이 있거나 이러면 1 20만 원 이상 쓰는 것은 스 소용이 되는 거는 기본이다 보니까 그런 부분들에 있어서 이 내가 어느 정도의 자금력 그 반려동물 주인이 있다라는 거 자체는 그 동물의 행복도 좌우한다라는 생각이 없지 않아 있네. 음 앞으로 만약에 반려동물을 키우게 된다면 어떤 동물을 키우고 싶어? 왜? 나는 일단 강아지를 키워 봤던 경험이 있고 보내 본 경험이 있기 때문에 그 잃어버린다라는 그 친구들은 우리보다는 짧은 인생을 살 살게 되어 있으니까 잃어버린다라는 것에 대한 아픔이 되게 커서 앞으로는 가족들 간의 협의가 있어야 되긴 하지만 만약에 키우게 된다고 하면 사실은 강아지를 한번 더 키워보고 싶어. 그러니까 잘해 주지 못했던 것에 대한 어 것을 사실은 간 친구한테 잘해 줬어야 되는데 내가 새롭게 맞이할 친구한테 더 잘해 줄 수 있을 거 같다는 앞으로의 학습이 있었기 때문에 그런 부분들 있지. 어 얼마 전에 name1 이슈가 있었었는데 그런 부분에 대해서는 어떻게 생각한 그러니까 엔터테이먼트적으로 너무 알려진 이런 사람들에 대한 이야 생각은 어떤지 궁금한 처음에 name1이 등장했을 때 거의 신처럼 생각했거든. 정말 와 이렇게 해야 되는구나. 그전에 알려지지 않았던 것들 책을 통해서도 몰랐던 것들을 직접 눈으로 보고 알게 해 주니까 근데 이슈가 처음에 터졌을 때는 실망했지 사실은. 근데 그것도 그 이슈 몰이를 하는 사람의 입장에서만 이야기를 한 부분이었었고 그 name1이 처음엔 침묵을 했었기 때문에 어 판단은 쪼끔 더 있다가 얘기를 해야 된다라는 생각 생각을 했었고 그 이후로 인제 다른 사람들도 텔레비전에 나오는 뭐 어 그런 사람들에 대해서도 쪼금 더 한번 재고하고 봐야 되겠다라는 생각을 갖게는 되었는데 어쨌든 배운 점은 많았지. 산책을 한다거나 이런 부분들에 대해서 배운 점은 많았었지. 어 요새 인제 노견들이 주변에 보면 많아지는데 그 노견들에 대한 입장은 어떤 생각을 가져 본 적이 있을까? 보통 동물들이 인제 버려지는 동물들이 생활하는 공간에 가면 어린 아기들보다는 어느 정도 연령대가 있거나 아니면 아프거나 나이가 많아서 버려지는 경우들이 많기 때문에 그중에서 아무래도 택하게 되겠지. 아 고양이를 좋아하잖아. 우리 동네에 캣 맘들이 계시거든. 그래서 그 나무들이 있는 사이에 항상 우산을 펴 놓고 그 아래에다가 밥을 주고 계시는데 주변 사람들이 그걸 지저분하다고 생각해서 치우는 경우들도 있는데 너는 고양이를 좋아하는 입장에서 캣 맘 활동할 생각은 가져 본 적이 없어? 이게 뭔가 이렇게 구조 작업을 해야 된다거나 그럴 때는 혼자서 다닐 그러니까 혼자서 하는 건 힘드니까 그런 협회의 노력이 필요하다고 생각은 하지. 근데 그것이 어떤 지원이 충분한 상태에서 해야 되는데 그렇지 못하니까 열악한 환경일 수도 있고 열악한 환경인 경우도 있고 최근에 봤던 것 중에 어떤 여자 탤런트분이 굉장히 많은 강아지들을 혼자서 케어하고 있는 모습을 봤는데 아 저것이 옳은 것인가? 이런 생각을 갖기도 했었고 아까 캣 맘에 대한 그 생각을 하는데 보통은 동네에서 하시는 분들은 연합한다기보다는 혼자 하시는데 이 혼자서 많은 사람들을 또 대적해야 되는데 그 분란이 일어났을 때 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을까? 정서적인 안정을 주는 거는 굉장히 좋고 따 반려동물은 어쨌든 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 없는 거 같아. 우리 엄마한테 어 너 너 좋고 나쁘고 뭐가 있을까 딸에 대해서 물어보면은 당장 이렇게 크게 대답하기가 힘든 것처럼 음 그런 거지. 트 반려동물도 인제 나의 가족이니까 좋고 나쁘고는 아니고 그냥 있는 존재 존재 자체로 좋은 것 이런 것이고 나쁘다라는 느낌이 들 때는 어 뭔가 이렇게 투자가 돼야 돈이 나가야 될 때 아픈데 내가 제대로 해 주지 못할 때 그건 나의 입장인 거고 그 동물 자체를 놓고 봤을 때는 항상 좋았던 거 같아. 그것이 나쁘다는 아니었던 거 같거든. 어 반면에 그 이제 그 강아지들 간혹가다 보면은 그 리드 줄에 대한 사용에 대해서 혹시 불편한 점을 느꼈던 적 있었나?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.340747702309256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2532857015350807,0.23655700811981975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.287465457078848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.340747702309256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.340747702309256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.340747702309256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.340747702309256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.340747702309256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31716993318961784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31753066006370956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3468093944438218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4665660302961447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4665660302961447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43428236098058554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3936097477623451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35355339059327373,0.35355339059327373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35355339059327373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35355339059327373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5965650497255655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8025647272625017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4133102035021788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36442044688796504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3847115292134796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6144461966211338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4133102035021788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5638004233040034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3422577593857465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4971094361453037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5638004233040034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3989142636467122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3615540413344197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4285687403879537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4285687403879537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4285687403879537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3989142636467122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4140025396135509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44327971729423293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.525807445992999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5963484880230641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5497822591861715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.590651956520991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.590651956520991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34889615079767033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32475455619706467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24221389907513524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29433974398769874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32475455619706467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32475455619706467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27430601933807625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4235981737315388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30762582223670565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2593426330354943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24186529752231092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2863475528020469,0.30763404871937505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30763404871937505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25952973953693936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22867155176073956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30763404871937505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30763404871937505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18675072928898107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30763404871937505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30763404871937505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23485503847141678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2863475528020469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3481642434215782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27413244539919107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.254746515256145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3948731075042948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3104536121006773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2590955497706894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3948731075042948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3208413094819077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30145537933886163,0.0,0.0,0.2637447480179607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6000391252797407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5290615240849095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6000391252797407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47337543431005535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5034009592660602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40200615436302756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5408227648981965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5408227648981965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.398746890922892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42094928395504483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42094928395504483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45224179938473225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45224179938473225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2784942143623753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5153986717208136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33250179131810104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5153986717208136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3578048126075155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4797360662093239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4074336045384946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5336928267083377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3705051493687047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5336928267083377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3564656023015008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3072091097155163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42016571708454736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42016571708454736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4513999837433737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4513999837433737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38081519485758447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48966351258195034,0.48966351258195034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48966351258195034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38497887879923176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36397829085840366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3761620635054163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3173421237721721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3173421237721721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3761620635054163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3761620635054163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3501338255311277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3316664967943872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3761620635054163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4095460452443443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2522018182987798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4095460452443443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4095460452443443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3126570436922489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4095460452443443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4095460452443443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38222663456937656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38222663456937656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.337013700126377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3557787633726578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38222663456937656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3005108149631535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2918007656833775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38222663456937656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3124119281862186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26400540671868694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2968285089500519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38090897127242224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38090897127242224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3124119281862186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38090897127242224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30418644995603095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3452350304175836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39668610392738735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3061913576799654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4499045422418899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2731167168389137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6869353312257696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5855880363762319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5111705718589606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6291194625175828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.322729315526744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30039831450146803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.322729315526744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27226458042683965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.322729315526744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19873936310532467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30039831450146803,0.0,0.322729315526744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.322729315526744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28455421712685386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.322729315526744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2482822437657065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.310904493187235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2154857810263022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2482822437657065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3340165022131482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2482822437657065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3340165022131482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3340165022131482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.310904493187235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20569010536945898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29450626181753287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3340165022131482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30594947245309323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.410209676342352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3885737291941019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.410209676342352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44070383113873124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27138903875415055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3885737291941019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4876193348224096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5238679665230724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5238679665230724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.461900521334749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33902613111868835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33902613111868835,0.3520085243215388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41725394443804953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3520085243215388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41725394443804953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41725394443804953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6018922119951032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.682640600302409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41440026056749585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37072424110955177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.398283128788569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3511708991242026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32361201144518537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.398283128788569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.398283128788569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.398283128788569,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6483100012630096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6483100012630096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39923462340422444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6222334051730695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6222334051730695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47502755601486263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42190380759776663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5192550418244031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3407086174670245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4082440669478128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5192550418244031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6353040297886359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7722621250160596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7666079302826107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6421154734374589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7761073535621005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6306008053807359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.557909753804356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.414707311092445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45331143747582614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.557909753804356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4319382075988834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4640476173096339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4640476173096339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4091562188504759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4640476173096339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4471773229354059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3903493133189434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42359156793519526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4804195775516578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2916410158302017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3903493133189434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34110425574877273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3607850721594129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3871347265008573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4271382606710164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4588908520689034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4588908520689034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32515710962217587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.468371403890749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.696302741350673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43596281316999835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8623237594543692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2655130267060427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4311618797271846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.356543072863659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.356543072863659,0.33187235550822364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.713086145727318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.356543072863659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4406955157021794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4406955157021794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28430816072456616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4406955157021794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4102019362858888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4102019362858888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4779320820762201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.598477077950232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6429666492831813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5035297977607228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5391381091742696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6751206129300446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43502659191624354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3942842779233211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4673655858491022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4673655858491022,0.0,0.0,0.4673655858491022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36722334190274314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4352888561263358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4352888561263358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3536798124469297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2680544526678564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40516938626477966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3536798124469297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.4314555865510328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36398947537010595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4314555865510328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4314555865510328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4314555865510328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.350565213841037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37347576337917987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31485714412871785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4235803591252282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27793178095427373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39427104949999714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25713649483345646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3573456863255531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39427104949999714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35668774740266357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.401033802823218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38383129339808497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46643402820667196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42208797278611754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41097483939350654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43085125329618357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5480096434053146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4623181361385987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5480096434053146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45558094685868067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4315519542325833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33310337182898775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37365599864339094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38480936952042033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45558094685868067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42466102294754454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4762443663152429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4388700706894413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4388700706894413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4556758071789936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38539154358871813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38539154358871813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35872467900294064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38539154358871813,0.35872467900294064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38539154358871813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38539154358871813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42682344141299716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3600816523375901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37633522701348854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42682344141299716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42682344141299716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42682344141299716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26517150490665203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5023707946450099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21176077433304763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2848838164013807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2848838164013807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42352154866609526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2848838164013807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2848838164013807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2848838164013807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21748697824362925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42770455718236505,0.0,0.0,0.42770455718236505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3475174368421049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42770455718236505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3771121171064799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32651967703059487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28567362151642456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4171568935012563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32797337154380407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3678121185104536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32797337154380407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4171568935012563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38829205052511356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38829205052511356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4906323620793828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4906323620793828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.527104976111226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4906323620793828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35627175077260154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35627175077260154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3374806855815956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35627175077260154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38275626965208726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38275626965208726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29220510151110407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35627175077260154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6222334051730695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6222334051730695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47502755601486263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36169700908428976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3189124889045774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33666966916781044,0.0,0.36169700908428976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36169700908428976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36169700908428976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36169700908428976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36169700908428976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5175205989278951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3375176366136691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5559920299159135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5559920299159135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32833526869084806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3527430461909903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32833526869084806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28660989745756094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31101767495770316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3527430461909903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3527430461909903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32833526869084806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3527430461909903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31966520485199573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3594083443167399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4612153434475216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41802032803864664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4955011560177159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3683175471554207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5408227648981965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40200615436302756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5034009592660602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5408227648981965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7814096218171822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6240184315639468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42815813152098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37724996182931064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3990162902012204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5075180198112685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5075180198112685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6421161003339589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6421161003339589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4187765840920649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48589645831902295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6180229088767786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6180229088767786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.5226951859452384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42469898489285074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5226951859452384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5226951859452384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47202833299075464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5353545006413468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4516418604824818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5353545006413468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42620886449912243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48372381584014396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5733829047661354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5055584222751789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2842855435742226,0.2842855435742226,0.0,0.0,0.2646146290969755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4796644154642201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2842855435742226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23098697868691265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5685710871484452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2842855435742226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45751305490749256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45751305490749256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45751305490749256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45751305490749256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40339461865133375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3854674784425307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3854674784425307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35879535960429837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30305880232302734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2373740391028583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3854674784425307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35879535960429837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3854674784425307,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47337543431005535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4475966346483546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3636800978620991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4475966346483546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.68341150979622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4891940351088578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4525917800743408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7455534029317102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2898624068182729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2745740114539697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5797248136365458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5254308214402801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26271541072014004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2745740114539697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2898624068182729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3385492915846936,0.0,0.0,0.3637163588168478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2386520838145949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3637163588168478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3385492915846936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3385492915846936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22079576544318036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3068425366503178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2776695876097104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3385492915846936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4223432614641059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4912186138520727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4912186138520727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5822668772189934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3739944807668536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41264020269945995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41264020269945995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39087606076976605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4433150378923408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41264020269945995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7319774557880256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6813288517434801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3648071187960828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4907785428172231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45681950775111163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45681950775111163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45681950775111163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33775641172403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2744329947115213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22986674852304934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25106220559001746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33775641172403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31438562260252606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33775641172403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33775641172403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33775641172403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22559520516508205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2978037838330253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5359586537871963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7020463843734303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4689127803961096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7761073535621005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6306008053807359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7761073535621005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6306008053807359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47337543431005535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4074668829215658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4074668829215658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4074668829215658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35926832269830566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4074668829215658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2509214530640717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3792725326022083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40930516603892914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40930516603892914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38098361716585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32180025642002213,0.0,0.40930516603892914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32180025642002213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38098361716585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5085652033554028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47337543431005535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3845351711189622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5539023217165246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48838216405454227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5539023217165246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.326210335644377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44615343510917993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42262168366903025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44615343510917993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47931957598246633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29516893158339574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5071133486156354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5751464362246284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5353496311650904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3541798991548622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34048412447205967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4459964343015761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3762565909415272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4151360619942064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4459964343015761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4151360619942064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5185625386493403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5185625386493403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4912116682863605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4699966850504731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37569315489172317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27250643743389985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37569315489172317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3169465377475269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3169465377475269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2868129542644691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2792614701545795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37569315489172317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37569315489172317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25963763033673637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34929301351821257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30797574074524403,0.0,0.34929301351821257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34929301351821257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34929301351821257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32512395831395874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34929301351821257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34929301351821257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4129183173708216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4129183173708216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4129183173708216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3843467593345981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30693180022394734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4129183173708216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27579755495449426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4091809548682948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3457806013960967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3720941255545925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5359816618126908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5359816618126908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29385383703675644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2735208520228639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24790432042731317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29385383703675644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2735208520228639,0.29385383703675644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2735208520228639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2735208520228639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18095760629437244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2735208520228639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24790432042731317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29385383703675644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19627167495200284,0.0,0.29385383703675644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48589645831902295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6180229088767786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6180229088767786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33437097096687063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2895125786098295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.308130493595365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.308130493595365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26327210123832384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3792293633239118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28189001622385945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3529888859524062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31992979417565853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.308130493595365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.398283128788569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32361201144518537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37072424110955177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.398283128788569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3511708991242026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.398283128788569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.398283128788569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5773502691896258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4253746536218198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4253746536218198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4253746536218198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3959411892008658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4253746536218198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34562434942965364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4160381890548318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4160381890548318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4160381890548318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3668257436983945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4160381890548318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4160381890548318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39805551683437457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3358121281936002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35097021099852427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26118368410879045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39805551683437457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2416415165218996,0.24512585653121058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35097021099852427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37051237858541514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3409418602335919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4700421917074195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4700421917074195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4700421917074195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4700421917074195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3067488744973691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6134977489947382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3841176957114806,0.0,0.4126722256228586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33530340440874706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3150436430173916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.257385393722838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3127762328414219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37074987638750095,0.0,0.0,0.32689450802798453,0.0,0.30124076208235434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37074987638750095,0.37074987638750095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34509613044187076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32689450802798453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2599727886095313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35556124377218024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2916223615949243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35556124377218024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38199294500326736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3368076532990958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25064424548858344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38199294500326736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35556124377218024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31325886452646085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3513102483329746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3708713493403307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3708713493403307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31325886452646085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39844117274665986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2961706015203163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39844117274665986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4597499844346639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38508938827347927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5658339486331143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5658339486331143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47004590944643876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23502295472321938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2785848867744253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2785848867744253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4380530491043271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24563155730084474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2785848867744253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41415726653787405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25930842475847143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39134689522823607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29876338629322974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39134689522823607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3642679547721556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39134689522823607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23756901550100962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.330152524436016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39134689522823607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5135345706149479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5517096883480437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41009865806845414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5135345706149479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44416671643125094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44416671643125094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.477185168670174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38772129950586326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31872284963709335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35470284726694024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29445547289160046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2466376982460101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3373230222228108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3057311132594862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36239893107938315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36239893107938315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27666383241696246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36239893107938315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3195313817481728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26937956403502816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5032839697367891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39568743312167626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42458615397951355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39568743312167626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5032839697367891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5145204236495425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45365868330991493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5145204236495425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5145204236495425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401348,50대,나는 아시다시피 반려동물을 키우고 있지 않잖아. 키웠던 경험도 초등학교 때 키웠던 경험밖에 없는데 음 반려동물을 키우면 어떤 느낌이고 어떤 부분을 좀 조심해야 되고 이런 거 있으면 얘기해 줄 수 있어? 맞아. 나도 그 분에 대해서는 동감을 하는데 그래서 반려동물을 키우기 전에 어 뭐 반려동물 행동 지도사라든가 뭐 이런 것들에 대해서 조금 공부를 해야 되지 않을까 이런 생각도 들고 요새는 센터 같은 데에서도 동물 관련 이런 지도사들에 관한 훈련을 많이 하고 있더라고. 그래서 그런 것들을 좀 받아 보면 어떨까 하는 생각을 하고 있는데 넌 너의 의견은 어때? 그럼 요새 길을 가다가 어 버려진 동물들을 많이 보잖아. 그리고 아기 이렇게 새끼 동물들도 보는데 그런 거들에 대해서 쉽게 다가가거나 또는 구조하거나 하는 것에 대해서 나는 솔직히 별로 좋게 생각하지 않거든. 왜냐하면 그들도 그들만의 삶이 있고 그다음에 우리가 꼭 구조한다고 해서 행복한 삶을 사는 건 아닌데 이렇게 좋은 환경을 마련해 줄 수 있다는 이유 하나만으로 너무나 쉽게 구조가 되고 있는 현실이지 않을까 싶어서 좀 좋게 않게 보는데 너는 그런 것에 대해선 어떻게 생각해? 나는 어 좋은 것 좋은 뭐 용품 이런 것들을 주는 것도 중요하지만 어 우리도 그렇잖아. 사는 게 이렇게 편안하지 않아도 행복감을 느낄 때가 있잖아 누구랑 함께 있을 때. 근데 동물들은 그게 조금 더 우리보다는 그런 수준이 어 더 이렇게 친밀감으로 더 많이 와닿는 거 같아. 그래서 얼마 전에 이렇게 어 유튜브에서 봤을 때 보면은 어 노숙자와 함께 지내는 강아지 그다음에 할머니 할아버지와 그냥 단칸방에서 사는 고양이 이런 사진을 봤을 때 어느 어 뭐 패리스 힐튼이 키우는 강아지 누가 더 행복할까요? 이렇게 물어보는 거에서 난 당연히 좋은 것보다는 어 사는 게 더 낫 어 그러니까 않을까 그렇게 생각을 했는데 너는 어때? 나는 고양이. 어 고양이가 주는 만족감이 되게 강아지보다는 큰 거 같아. 강아지는 계속 돌봐야 되고 치근대고 막 이런 부분이 있는데 고양이는 되게 쌔 마 새침하고 어 그다음에 자기의 시간이 굉장히 정확한 거 같아. 내가 내가 성향이 그래서 그런지 너 이렇게 막 사랑해 줄 땐 사랑해 주지만 자기 시간이 필요할 땐 자기 시간으로 가지는 그런 부분들이 고양이랑 성향이 잘 맞는 거 같아서 요새도 많이 보는 그 랜선 집사라고 하잖아. 그래서 많이 보는 그 유튜브에서도 동물 관련 유튜브가 많은데 그중에서도 이제 어 똥괭이네라고 이렇게 많은 고양이를 키우는 어 22마리 고양이를 키우는 음 집사를 보게 됐는데 어 지금은 줄었지만 그걸 보면서 참 많이 키우고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 어 너는 그런 부분에 대해서 어떻게 생각해? 처음에는 굉장히 좋게 봤지. 그리고 나는 그건 좋다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 많은 사람들이 같은 동물을 키우고 여러 상황에 놓여 있다 보니까 상황이 다른데 교정이 되지 않고 문제가 있다고 생각하는 걸 그 전문가들이 그게 어떤 문제가 있고 이거는 문제가 있고 없고를 또 판단해 주기도 하고 또 개선이 되기도 하는 부분은 되게 좋은 거 같은데 name1의 이슈 같은 경우에는 그 사람이 어 쪼끔 너무 과하게 나간 부분도 있지만 그 반려인들이 어 동물들도 교 교육이 필요하다는 거 그리고 본인들도 교육이 필요하다는 거를 느낄 수 있는 부분에서는 긍정적으로 본다고 생각해. 다만 그 사람 자체가 인성적인 부분에서 문제가 있었던 부분들이 어 회사나 이런 거를 통해서 어 드러나서 그렇지 그 외에 여타로 행동하는 사람들이 안 좋다고 보지는 않아. 너는 그런 부분에 대해선 어떻게 생각하는데? 노견들을 많이 보지는 않지만 어 이 노견들에 대한 케어가 더 많이 이루어져야 되지 않을까? 이런 생각도 들고 어 나 아침에 운동할 때 보면 할머니께서 3마리 강아지를 데리고 정말 새벽에 산책을 하시거든. 근데 그 아이들이 다 나이가 많아. 어 나이가 많고 할머니도 나이가 많고 걷는 것도 되게 느리게 걷고 그럼에도 불구하고 할머니가 항상 같이 어 이렇게 휠체어에도 태우고 다니시고 걸리기도 하시는 모습을 보면 아 이 노견들이 마지막까지 행복하게 살 수 있게 어 해 줄 수 있는 건 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 것 아닐까? 이런 생각을 하면서 나도 만약에 어 동물을 키우게 된다면 만약에 입양을 하게 된다면 어린 동물보다는 어 성인이 된 동물들을 입양을 하고 싶다 이런 생각을 했어. 너는 만약에 입양을 한다면 어떤 나이가 몇 살 정도 되는 동물들 입양하고 싶어? 음 살짝 내 집 앞에서. 내 집 앞에서 내가 활동 영역을 넓히거나 나는 사람들과 연합을 해서 뭔가를 하는 거보다는 그냥 내가 마음이 당겨서 하는 걸 좋아하기 때문에 우리 집 앞에 쓰레기장이 있는데 거기를 좀 치우고 옆에다가 음식물 쓰레기와 별개로 아이들이 먹을 만한 음식을 이렇게 놓기도 하거든. 왜냐하면 그래야지 음식물 쓰레기를 뒤지지 않지 않을까? 그리 병에 걸리지 않게 그래서 나 나름은 활동은 하지만 나는 캣 맘들이 어 이렇게 서로 연합체를 만든다거나 뭐 이렇게 어 동아리를 만든다거나 해 가지고 활동 영역을 넓히고 막 이러는 것에 대해서는 어 별로 좋게 생각하지 않아. 대신에 그러면 너는 동물 협회 활동가들의 생각은 어떻게 생각해? 글쎄 그 부분이 제일 풀기 어려운 부분일 거 같아. 서로가 이해를 할 수 있고 공감을 하는 부분을 넓혀 가야 될 텐데 그런 것에 대해서 불만을 제기하거나 이렇게 목소리를 높인 분들은 서로 정말 이해를 하려고 하는 마음이 쪼끔도 없는 분들이 많아서 참 이해시키기가 너무 어렵더라고. 그러니까 고양이 자체를 키우는 것에 대해서 정말 불신을 가지고 있고 정말은 주변의 쓰레기를 제대로 모 안 버리는 사람들이 더 지저분한데 그거를 깡그리 몰아서 어 그 고양이에게 밥을 주는 사람들한테 몰아세우는 거라서 어 대체적으로는 캣 맘들이 어 그분들에 의해서 폭행을 당한다거나 이런 부분이 많아서 조금 안타깝다 이렇게 생각을 하게 되더라고. 어 너는 그 반려동물이 어 우리에게 미치는 영향이 어떤 점이 좋고 어떤 점은 안 좋은 거 같아? 사람들이 리드 줄을 사용하지 않는 사람과 사용하는 사람들에 대해서 이야기한다면 나는 산책을 할 때는 반드시 사용해야 된다라고 생각을 하거든. 왜냐하면 커다란 동물들 같은 경우에는 좀 위협적일 수도 있고 나는 무엇보다 강아지를 잃어버릴까 봐 어 리드 줄을 해야 되지 않을까 훈련을 시키고 해야 되지 않을까 싶기도 한데 또 한편으로는 뭐 산이나 이런 둘레길을 돌 때는 오히려 하지 않는 게 좋다라고 얘기하는 사람들도 있고 아니다 해야 된다라고 하는 경우도 있는데 나는 그냥 일상생활에든 산책은 무조건 리드 줄을 해야 된다고 생각해. 왜냐하면 잃어버릴 가능성이 너무 많아서 그 아이들이 어디로 튈지 모르니까 어 너는 산책 둘레길 산책할 땐 어때?,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34964768323213496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4820445434281745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4820445434281745,0.0,0.0,0.4820445434281745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42502431937922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
