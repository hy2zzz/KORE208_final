SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5293595899095636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5293595899095636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46880531627828054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46880531627828054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.360221280463054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34138725470259035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4541059419279495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4541059419279495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40216005110202835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4237195437282305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5387314481885804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3595904339632868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5387314481885804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5387314481885804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4302934710951642,0.4611513084287736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.331411811063587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35564766573179013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4611513084287736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3914171937317234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3357686120410868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21101864560880063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31330072997565844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20547275941886342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3357686120410868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3357686120410868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22411756603605723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2973595139574842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3357686120410868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3357686120410868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3357686120410868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4632449523244374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2832201322802288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42139156512815396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4396743469993032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29635745880703773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4964658546729225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6573597657777391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6573597657777391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3684511862828942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40369544644270816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.536986950841487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.536986950841487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28084188762368717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42596695872956136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36064274027249305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5002182011357655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5219210092035126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5893360885719057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39883718180529387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5934134092767931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6991347710564139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23872378825489426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41846675450831805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.355187288262821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.355187288262821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3145944664352448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3227286179330622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41846675450831805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3705976862206901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6167141634575802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4892108759846147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6167141634575802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33723149145486814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25454571263031217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36141553143251254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3200726420202345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36141553143251254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36141553143251254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3067632043946009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3200726420202345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36141553143251254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24832099179476586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4489746519094719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4489746519094719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4489746519094719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39761573739565165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4189316128411435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.569003903317534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5936910947781017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.569003903317534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3936104547361707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32224638144246814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34858473755911945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3936104547361707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3936104547361707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3936104547361707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3936104547361707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44816807055166735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.396901422144247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3369232884322532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35551104121511956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44816807055166735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44816807055166735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3975235986347349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29193775470670386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4397284071827988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3975235986347349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3975235986347349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3975235986347349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29884984424832484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2968318998498914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3582240683459208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5366843855910424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5366843855910424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45552835325008223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3181386892010044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40704026661952575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5131273850291624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4544299387694867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5131273850291624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6062717369731552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5146544101580269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6062717369731552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4285216552271996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45925242949917433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45925242949917433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45925242949917433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4285216552271996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.367047719916551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20300846263379552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.367047719916551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3115437078230781,0.0,0.3424868032979949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32506055563118774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3424868032979949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.367047719916551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3424868032979949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.384724570275653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4699249449335191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26253743509764754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43848002166273625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4161694935464358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3136637288337156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3136637288337156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3940543404159878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27753329387557124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3940543404159878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34897784645992097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36768628178770485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33446645663644264,0.0,0.34897784645992097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34897784645992097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42867676179058284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.751441549042873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5015693693526223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3998863468708048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34823414407143416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42132394795289935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42132394795289935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3998863468708048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45153854967017554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3134997324663764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4194154655787114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4780180852521919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.321961359407834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4780180852521919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.406382687092867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30697960607515834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.549473542418541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.549473542418541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.549473542418541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3220114764046786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4059374965753974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4059374965753974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4059374965753974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35950166975109427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3787742791931985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35950166975109427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5151609508683835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5521049295489441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4054608935131983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5151609508683835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2459780888183486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3193693227508239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19525700470533514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2573131637280795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.342272404653757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.342272404653757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5430177960151302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3193693227508239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3193693227508239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21690456863797558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29018567233132536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3544496417088443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2664677533166881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30085067859743303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3544496417088443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3544496417088443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3544496417088443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3544496417088443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2811685380154945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5415316964635281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8406803326623821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.508286013284216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.508286013284216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4742741676487488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.508286013284216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4295970487659205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3741071975656806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4526274178434232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4850868999661604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4850868999661604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5272979126858314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5796701135881454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6212402680846375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.534161348819659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4730577944565335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45338684360956616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.534161348819659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5015045135060211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4561944405540529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5015045135060211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5374691416944353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4494548320168333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4494548320168333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.300000415114536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3980409889475137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3814894283973698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4494548320168333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4741478498440915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43627188669323863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7647552924755386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42720892373776537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5033196224107301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3004487073207316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4696401017170078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5033196224107301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3878992499657285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4738026831748573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4738026831748573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41960365122927945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4738026831748573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40110701585216846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42987179124379493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3519333075269947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42987179124379493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42987179124379493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40110701585216846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4161036731395097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23737571524732806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27773930944825365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35318154598033635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3882601883114935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3685049214354431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3300758349633672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4161036731395097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3307573932870495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5524183967123522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4846946720208722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5920342360660314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3466818124406035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5286134532583394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5286134532583394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5665221575468036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6158104843639242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7878943122954176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33227416954651007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33227416954651007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33227416954651007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31004011732412545,0.33227416954651007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31004011732412545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22178510874716187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31004011732412545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33227416954651007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33227416954651007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4718377810802221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2691704928234989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4718377810802221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3323163333764962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3862905970901099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4718377810802221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.382557902416364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6916805535899325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6125581303715724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5544152277689604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38569426647235766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7374711438613999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3819768729923745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4313157590605351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4313157590605351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4313157590605351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36609329939658697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40245436088330766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2686939841010749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2379576578939389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5014287717199348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2686939841010749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2280627709542391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2379576578939389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18924173344569542,0.0,0.2379576578939389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2686939841010749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2507143858599674,0.0,0.0,0.14052580899745187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2507143858599674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2686939841010749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2379576578939389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31029482475436426,0.2945065537499681,0.0,0.0,0.31029482475436426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3325471429300528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3325471429300528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3325471429300528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3325471429300528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5275885936749111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33825724612230657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3156228376603191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33825724612230657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28710685542175735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2995634692834781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3156228376603191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17690709868184637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28710685542175735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2683238580996514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3156228376603191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33825724612230657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2894918007459526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4337110287825674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4337110287825674,0.4337110287825674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4337110287825674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4046893516641299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23928697541582764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36721795036344634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43264077562393205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43264077562393205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2887774322065657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43264077562393205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4036907142577896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3321022374914354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30209736973251716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21780339660187076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31520437227298764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35591844087596686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35591844087596686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35591844087596686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18614382829796633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3321022374914354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35591844087596686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.842369890979654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5388997743281452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714923968769672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34663406568723215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714923968769672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714923968769672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714923968769672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34663406568723215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3153162721660433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32899679902396106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38487330129007274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6301866587241622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2893396179268404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32667375063187565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38487330129007274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34084704079732175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.353379896932743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3297335596520965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.353379896932743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.353379896932743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6259124327047458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.353379896932743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.585365197516415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6273437662354435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5136023602964628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26550786193467185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4282388767030601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33970213174288727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37925196003293693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4282388767030601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39958336742508593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37925196003293693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26570956497114195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4482671231140975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4482671231140975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36116503191437277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48041391337762135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40776695710706756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4203265400603675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4203265400603675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4746189455376924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4746189455376924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44285992425950943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45472326043275385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37227904764469255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.385961178619574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3035169658315126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45472326043275385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45472326043275385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46670513051066925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3961311811238174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46670513051066925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4354756604065341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46670513051066925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4609484268370811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5430700887907284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44460803537282245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5430700887907284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28820713737330456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5158720435781804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5158720435781804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5158720435781804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34433232484113524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25684987443264873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.333044940476871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28268274122904324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.333044940476871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29494740745475984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28268274122904324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.333044940476871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29494740745475984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44459916003802225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2641891766511063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33702252980454367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4535094216859148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5628821890278712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6032484232233387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.455202180093771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4362737112787841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3620108316396361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5139993746089302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.455202180093771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4278845797040444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4585696670804855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4278845797040444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4061131637343535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30608435082510765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4061131637343535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7623971469451413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6471094114057596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46826197065151604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5516865991364375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41474633151855905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5516865991364375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2695655778005194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375093810058015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375093810058015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31837308890933114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375093810058015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375093810058015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3499944911055204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375093810058015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49586565716810366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4350750146951689,0.5314259034095173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5314259034095173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5551662693883015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8317393902740665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20323318856090752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3637741981734008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3637741981734008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3221614971737722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.190252355897506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2428106289797112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3637741981734008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33943232853489624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33943232853489624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3637741981734008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.593527102829831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.593527102829831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44620113836521236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31041214624180397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6629908363933527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7486275114223646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4334110168648159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6870351396515659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5832131748718984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3837948464160494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3398919520675705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32575837692992354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35811329954906646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3837948464160494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30444673422275104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3398919520675705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3837948464160494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4077707884303149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4077707884303149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34525835261376425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4077707884303149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42546260999307145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44827133497143384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38891715587958575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29290134407728147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5295777777401974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4494963883589771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5295777777401974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4483290964226437,0.4483290964226437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3292488552348185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4483290964226437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3370443442805764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41832925455627107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6632086417080864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6632086417080864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34685529421853994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49876217858323624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5345301444222399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4240180876127606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5345301444222399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5175126760642311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3056169240948589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5843583433506685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5452561346524197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3699527588337691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3699527588337691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3699527588337691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3699527588337691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2781226692866063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3451974521815801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3451974521815801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3699527588337691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4438292907120967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4206238535325537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5595047517874276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5595047517874276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32328186254488644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3021322374356358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38087712111605837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27971273136904934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2330767983329329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38087712111605837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38087712111605837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19919711173481552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2273585880464212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38087712111605837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4949734442362939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5441351193334197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4384050661010994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5164486997038101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48315092897695017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45856747738779646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5177993579573094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34561876136958547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4107463270672721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4568672244638021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4568672244638021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5580441746786678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5207027727299789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47276850852983576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4453522322714751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42408651628172583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4341274374256127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4580778551028079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4354419785619435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4354419785619435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5318741343991916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39985173904345456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.421911197473065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3645331555672395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42879149769333214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3454736851393099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37622381075051015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45954162330453224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45954162330453224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47833489820699693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4463272247816489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47833489820699693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4463272247816489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37944099297786316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5356345600470794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3197385994840621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42489416954389336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4997926924819458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42489416954389336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.501008052250258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6119603465831763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6119603465831763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35477504994190384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43334286055159776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4043458193285269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43334286055159776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3837720911649746,0.43334286055159776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3370577586681248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37132169780676055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5513036947186581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3090065910573423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5908395949259002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4763487577780541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45946243227518424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5612141122965875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4970159498952017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4458942398370702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32147674787010755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29349327008092213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5253338775471705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36999374570060395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4458942398370702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19731698283387658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2743733401434261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.217375435478772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34588340784749166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34588340784749166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.322738696468231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46173790353906613,0.0,0.20646964303463008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34588340784749166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34588340784749166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2859963835571375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35575070104834206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.391530591901727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4612849093929316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4612849093929316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4612849093929316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6137221531654243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5435175136259606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5726550716581923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3751948589124452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24168509783949915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42365773115971417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3953087682178218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35959329877711227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3953087682178218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42365773115971417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7071067811865476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6039792642956362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5635641260322121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5635641260322121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4279521518872047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5725355795907547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.699328224654053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49568734393505676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4207307787815996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49568734393505676,0.3726472743747034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4389848913256022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3762198706693672,0.3762198706693672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3762198706693672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3762198706693672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2828341515794506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3762198706693672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.298437855652782,0.35104520162127967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26160718419969736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3892345502105939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42789404339523046,0.0,0.3447506137974639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4585798094457924,0.0,0.4585798094457924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2398352867030546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5113194209325039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42261751737747744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44863422453295115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41196573528887176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4346935119237037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37486315433347495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45787963849448865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3886402573095815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3531244987063342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40550206860041144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45787963849448865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2581548685755562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37025496344564807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41336190585040555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46675470897458327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4355219213385519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46675470897458327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2859380593771833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5012301981829139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5012301981829139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4438936897837449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4676904908471164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4009083650869999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48969277229138325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48969277229138325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3884506701660664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4569250892454494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4082482904638631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4082482904638631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4082482904638631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4082482904638631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4082482904638631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4082482904638631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36628853627883207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2552328909077025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4474061017659481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4474061017659481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4474061017659481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4474061017659481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2505106837827907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40112190893674887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45293370583804565,0.0,0.45293370583804565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40112190893674887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45293370583804565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19834017268323978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3244122622884677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19229480958841677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34767699087764914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34767699087764914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34767699087764914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21276006195997837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3244122622884677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3244122622884677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30790567466421653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3244122622884677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4885353534953368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.665225133271531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5646314996960939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5992965910932007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5992965910932007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5307421142213401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5277004527061303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5277004527061303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49238949417072175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4479029475877462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4466050177736883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30860006512315813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5042917408383193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26374243207983555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40003135797008454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47054717105602395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42426319264289175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2895187336826375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4835431585964648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4835431585964648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5182197157233319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3500285707530366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3847940537712674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3500285707530366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36521514907432234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36521514907432234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4123889700687259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4123889700687259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31965622867859633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21595007491050933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36432003803446605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34578288229113885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3904466916470086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34578288229113885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2042019563543143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3904466916470086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36432003803446605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31454077442440986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2260484266227285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6290815488488197,0.0,0.31454077442440986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2934933483961801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31454077442440986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2669767275710144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31454077442440986
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42658748783212147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4494565166507334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4494565166507334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42658748783212147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4816886024503148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32511016074219456,0.0,0.0,0.23364424039878062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32511016074219456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32511016074219456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18546641599695246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.217003303186112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3033554865770756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32511016074219456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19895034689732918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32511016074219456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3033554865770756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28792029961725196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17003122903712878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4877255417145659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8729970194446447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24618548570039472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2853617024385919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3250817391433103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30622995310828743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37050362528077746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21961538559795027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39707372538322194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39707372538322194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39707372538322194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35559693682661647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2373525014354434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26733026555100736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5008953286258494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35559693682661647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3318022468141077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28207863426888924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28207863426888924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.314919645576025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41361697364910677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41361697364910677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36630267939938865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41361697364910677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35107087879063686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.338625591515217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.338625591515217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32046343000326977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17724340657968815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32046343000326977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2720037744073674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32046343000326977,0.29901969079302143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.262361376484306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32046343000326977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32046343000326977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.262361376484306,0.0,0.0,0.2542088452030782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29901969079302143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5151679110786477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3591933059889283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6059795022244909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48823256262908643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20568456052116038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6386143817311742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3605512090896332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3605512090896332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24065936038904737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3193071908655871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3605512090896332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39789914619828687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37127381324541453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39789914619828687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39789914619828687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39789914619828687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39789914619828687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26558822050607034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4485118941277535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39352658549296776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27421258957432415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4485118941277535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4079896134793064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4485118941277535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3894433555840477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4212739621550872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47568874349884516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44385813692780557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4975663726509846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2550337400638051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3642907034426237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3838200493165944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4113451163761641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4113451163761641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4113451163761641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3838200493165944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5435175136259606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5726550716581923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6137221531654243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.527429135029643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.527429135029643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.527429135029643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40676224328918253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44174309517083427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4734220247612208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40183236390285254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44174309517083427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4734220247612208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2159897462223216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21817463659749575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3643869657900332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34584640466105887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39051841902407397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34584640466105887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39051841902407397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3643869657900332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3097802339868506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2671305870793179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20118142595877309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33940448868796114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3637443618344763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3637443618344763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3637443618344763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3221350738604466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19023675161935696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3637443618344763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3221350738604466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2946232155445469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4413988153992304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23084970001100083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.390906512704241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4413988153992304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4413988153992304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3501413035974188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5140520429522497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4552488236227037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5140520429522497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5140520429522497,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43890798812337695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4165756844248806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24600862010738692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4703836023535022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39925340391626385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43890798812337695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401851,50대,어 친구는 반려동물을 키워 본 적 있나? 나도 애완동물을 직접 키운 적은 없는데 우리 직장 내에서 지금 강아지 2마리하고 고양이 2마리를 키우고 있어서 내가 집에서는 어차피 못 키우니까 그 동물한테 이제 관심을 많이 주기 시작을 했어. 그래서 인제 매일 출근하면은 밥도 갖다주고 물도 갖다주고 이렇게 또 이렇게 보면은 쓰다듬어 주고 이러니까 아이들이 되게 좋아하는 거야. 그리고 잘 따르더라고 그래서 아 그래서 사람들이 애완동물을 키우는구나 이런 생각을 하게 됐고 아 나도 기회가 되면은 키워 보고 싶은 생각은 있는데 현재는 아파트에 살다 보니까 그런 걸 키울 만한 환경이 되지 않아서 지금은 못 키우고 있는데 나중에 혹시라도 뭐 전원주택 같은 데 이사를 가게 되면 아 그곳에서 애완동물을 한번 키워볼까라는 생각은 있어. 그러니까 사람한테 느낄 수 없는 그런 또 애완동물만의 그런 귀여움과 또 그렇게 사람을 잘 때르 따르는 그런 어 또 특별한 저 저 좋은 장점이 있어 가지고 아 애완동물을 키우는 것도 아이들 한 들의 정서감에도 좋을 것 같고 아 나한테도 되게 의지가 되고 좋을 것 같다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 근데 나 같은 경우는 이제 우리 애들이 어릴 때 자꾸 집에서 남들이 키우는 걸 보니까 키우고 싶어 하잖아. 그래서 우리 딸내미가 아빠 우리도 강아지나 고양이 좀 한 마리 꼭 키우자고 내가 잘 돌볼 수 있다고 계속 그러는 거야. 근데 뭐 집도 작은 데다가 또 아이들이 그때 볼 때만 좋아하지 뭐 뒤치다꺼리 안 하잖아 사실. 응 데리고 노는 것만 좋아하지. 그래서 이거 안 된다 고양이나 강아지 키우면 이거 똥은 누가 치우고 어 밥은 누가 주고 너희들이 매일 그 저거 할 수 있냐 그랬더니 아 할 수 있다는 거야. 그래서 아니야 너희들 방도 안 치우는 애들이 어 평상시에 그 강아지나 고양이 돌볼 수 있겠냐. 아빠는 못 믿는다. 그리고 사 주진 않았고 대신 햄스터 있잖아 조그만 그 쥐 그 새끼 그거를 2마리를 샀어. 고거는 이제 조그만 집만 있으면 되니까. 그래서 햄스터를 사 가지고 인제 집 안에서 그걸 키우게 했는데 고것도 어쨌든 살아서 계속 움직이니까 그래도 고거 보는 것만 해도 좋아하더라고. 그래서 매일 밥도 주고 물도 갈아주고 그렇게 해라. 근데 어느 날인가 그 햄스터가 자기 집에서 탈출을 한 거야. 어 그래 가지고 그 우리 깜짝 놀랐지 집안에 아무 저기 찾아봐도 아무리 봐도 없으니까. 그래서 막 찾다 보니까 어느 구석에서 나타났거든. 그런 에피소드가 있었어. 이렇게 애완동물을 키우면은 우리에게 주는 이점도 많긴 한데 또한 친구 말대로 동물을 키우다 보면 매일 이렇게 손이 가야 되고 밥도 줘야 되고 이러다 보니까 장시간 집을 경우 집을 비울 경우에는 애매한 경우가 생기더라고. 그러면은 어디 뭐 요즘에 애견 호텔도 있고 뭐 이렇게 맡길 데는 있다고 하는데 비용도 상당히 비쌀뿐더러 또 그렇게 맡긴다고 해도 우리 애를 잘 봐줄까 하는 그런 또 의구심도 들고 이래서 어디 장거리 여행 갈 때는 좀 많이 이렇게 어려움이 있을 것 같고 또 인제 애완동물이 또 우리가 키우다가 또 나이가 들면 언젠가는 또 이별을 하게 되잖아. 그게 사람들이 키우다 보면은 그게 가장 슬프대. 내 가족을 키우는 것 같은데 내 자식을 키우는 것처럼 키웠는데 어느 날 병이 들어서 병원 치료를 다 했음에도 불구하고 이별을 하게 되는 날 그날이 너무 슬퍼 가지고 애완동물을 키우기가 어렵다 그런 사람들도 들었어. 나 또한 또 물론 애완동물이 사람은 아니지만 그래도 또 우리 인간하고 많은 교감을 이루고 또 사람 말을 잘 따르고 이러기 때문에 얼마나 많은 정을 주겠어. 근데 이제 그 위기 상황이 오면은 우리도 이제 그거를 극복을 못 하고 이제 많은 어려움을 겪게 되는 거지. 근데 요즘 뭐 워낙 뭐 애완동물을 거의 뭐 많은 집들에서 키우다 보니까 우리 아파트 앞에 바로 공원 있잖아. 큰 공원이 있는데 거기에 산책을 나가다 보면은 정말 강아지 끌고 와서 산책하는 사람들이 엄청 많아. 진짜 사람 반 개 반 정도 도 될 정도로 그렇게 많은데 근데 대부분은 이제 질서를 잘 지키고 목줄도 해가지고 이렇게 다니긴 하는데 이렇게 간혹 가다 보면은 배변을 보잖아. 근데 배변을 보면은 주 주인이 그 배변 봉투를 들고 다니면서 직접 치워야 되는데 그걸 안 치우고 그냥 가는 사람이 있더라고. 그러니까 그런 것 때문에 좀 눈살이 찌푸려지더라고. 그러니까 자기가 어떻게 가종 가족처럼 사랑하는 이렇게 애완동물인 만큼 어 배변 처리도 또 확실하게 하고 또한 이렇게 질서를 잘 지켜서 사람들한테 피해를 주지 않는 선에서 애완동물을 키우게 된다면 아 누가 뭐래나 뭐 너무 좋지. 어 나도 인제 보기에도 좋더라고 강아지를 이렇게 사랑하면서 많이 데리고 다니니까. 어 친구는 그럼 어떻게 생각해? 얼마 전에 그 우리 아파트 앞에 그 공원에서 아 고양이가 한 마리 계속 돌아다니더라고. 그러니까 주인이 없는 고양이 같아. 주인이 없는 고양이가 계속 돌아다니니까 어느 누가 거기 공원 한쪽 켠에다가 조그맣게 박스로 집을 지어 줬어. 집을 지어 주고 거기다가 인제 밥그릇을 갖다 놓고 사료를 넣더라고 사료하고 물을 갖다 놨더라고. 그래서 내가 이렇게 유심히 찾아봤더니 고양이가 한 마리가 거기에 있더라고. 근데 사람을 보니까 도망을 가는 거야. 그래서 내가 이제 유심히 보다 아 나도 이제 밥 좀 챙겨줘야 되겠다 하고서 인제 그 고양이 그거 재료 파는 데에 가 가지고 그 참치 캔 있더라고 고양이용. 그래서 그 참치 캔하고 사료 조그만 것을 샀어. 사서 갔는데 그다음 날인가 그 갔더니 안 보이는 거야 고양이가. 그리고 그 집 앞에 누가 경고문을 써 놨어. 이 고양이는 주인이 없는 고양이니까 여기다 밥을 주지 마시오. 그리고 시청에다 신고하겠음 이렇게 누가 써 놨더라고. 그래서 아 그래도 주인이 없는 고양이 같은데 그래도 이런 것 좀 사람들이 좀 챙겨 주면 좀 안 되나 아 좀 세상이 좀 너무 어 무정하다 그런 생각이 들더라고. 그래서 어쨌든 또 며칠 있다가 또 가 봤지. 그랬더니 아예 집을 다 치워 버렸더라고. 집까지 다 치워버리고 고양이도 어디로 갔는지 모르겠고 그래서 아 참 그 고양이가 누군가의 주인의 품으로 돌아가서 잘 살아만 살았으면 좋겠다 그런 생각은 들더라고. 맞아. 그렇기는 한데 요즘 그래서 유기견 센터에 그런 동물들이 많이 넘친다 그러더라고. 그러니까 주인들이 키우다가 어 키울 능력이 안 되거나 아니면 또 뭐 키우다가 뭐 정이 떨어져서 이렇게 뭐 버리는 경우가 많이 있다고 하더라고. 근데 나는 좀 그건 안타깝게 생각하는 게 그러면 본인들이 좋아서 어쨌든 고양이나 강아지를 키웠으면은 그래도 끝까지 좀 이렇게 책임을 질 줄 아는 그런 자세를 보여야 되는데 아 키우다가 아우 귀찮아 아우 힘들어 아이 돈 없어 이러면서 그냥 어디 뭐 펜션에 놀러 갔다 버린다거나 바닷가에 놀러 갔다가 버린다거나 그래서 그렇게 유기견 강아지 고양이들이 이렇게 많이 돌아다니는 거래. 근데 문제는 그런 강아지 같은 경우 유기견들이 커 가지고 사납게 된다는 거지. 그렇게 해서 주인이 없다 보니까 누가 관리도 안 하고 이러다 보니까 이 강아지들이 나중에 돌아다니다가 사람을 물 수도 있는 거고 사람을 공격해서 상해를 입힐 수도 있는 그런 심각한 상황도 발생할 수 있다고 하더라고. 그래 어 그런 건 어떻게 생각해? 그래서 지금은 그 동물을 키우려면 이제 동물을 등록해야 된다고 그 유관 기관에 이제 등록제가 생겼다고 얘기를 들었어. 그래서 나는 그건 잘한 것이라고 생각을 해. 그래야 뭐 칩 같은 것을 이렇게 동물한테 이렇게 해 가지고 아 이 사 이 동물은 이 사람의 소유입니다라는 것을 정확하게 해 줘야 함부로 동물을 뭐 버리거나 어 어디다 뭐 맡기거나 이런 걸 못 할 거 같아서 그거는 잘한 것이라고 생각을 하거든. 근데 동물이 등록되기 전에 또 그런 동물들도 있을 것 아니야 유기견들. 그러니까 그런 동물은 뭐 유기견 센터에서 새로운 입양자를 잘 또 이렇게 선택을 해서 좋은 집으로 이렇게 보내 주 주든지 그렇게 하고 동물이 등록된 후에는 그 가정에서 끝까지 동물이 잘 살 수 있도록 이렇게 책임을 져 주는 그런 자세가 어 중요하다고 생각을 해.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3179311989301349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48790805694639916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5748327933902329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5748327933902329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게

SD2401852,50대,아니 없어. 없고 어 키워 보진 않았고 전에 군 생활 할 때 아 내가 어디서 근무했냐면 저기 그 인제 가면 언제 오나 뭐 원통해서 못 살겠나 하는 그런 그 원통에 있는 지오피 사단에서 근무를 했었는데 아 그때 내가 지오피 순찰을 돌고 있는데 거기 소초에 그 병사가 하나가 있었어. 근데 그 병사가 아 군 오기 전에 그 애견 센터 이런 데서 근무를 했는가 봐. 근데 그때 올 때 어 셰퍼드를 하나 갖고 온 거야. 근데 거기서 말할 때는 되게 순종이라고 이야기해 가지고 갖고 왔는데 그 본인 휴가 갔다 오면서 인제 그걸 들고 왔어. 그런데 그게 한 거의 한 100일 정도 된 이제 그 아이였는데 그래서 내가 딱 보고 어 너무 이쁜 거야 셰퍼드가. 근데 원래 어릴 때 꿈이 그 꿈 꿈보다는 어릴 때 보통 인제 옛날 우리 이야기하면 똥개라고 그러잖아. 많이 키웠었는데 그때 내가 되게 데리고 다니고 있던 그 그 뭐야 그 강아지가 생각나 가지고 어 그때 그렇게 했었는데 친구는 뭐 어떻게 키운 적 있어? 아 나 그때 인제 그래 가지고 그 친구한테 내가 이야기를 했지. 야 이거 혹시 그 내가 가지고 가도 돼 그랬더니 아 얼마든지 갖고 가래. 그래서 그거를 이제 지프차에 태워 가지고 이제 가지고 온 거야. 그래가지고 사무실에 있다가 인제 퇴근했을 것 아니야. 근데 퇴근 인제 해 가지고 그 애견에 대한 뭐 기르는 것 관련된 것은 교육을 전혀 내가 받은 게 없으니까 인제 이 강아지를 데리고 집을 갔지. 그랬더니 난리가 난 거야 이게. 왜 그러냐면 그 그 지오피 거기 안에는 온리 볼 수 있는 게 산하고 군복 입은 장병밖에 볼 수가 없잖아. 근데 이게 우리 아이들이 인제 그 얼룩덜룩한 옷 옷과 이렇게 이런 걸 보니까 얘가 계속 짖는 거야. 그래가지고 저녁 12시까지 짖었어. 그래서 도저히 아파트에서 어떻게 할 수가 없잖아. 그래서 내가 전에 다니던 이제 교회 목사님한테 한 번 들었는데 강아지 있으면 본인들이 이렇게 키울 사람이 있다고 그래 가지고 내가 그걸 전화를 했지. 그랬더니 다음 날 좀 갖다 달래. 그러면 아는 권사님 드린다고 그래 가지고 그날 저녁에 다시 부대를 간 거야 그 강아지를 데리고. 근데 사무실에다가 먹이하고 이거 놔두고 그래가지고 집에 왔다니까. 그래 갖고 그다음 날 다시 그냥 갖다 드린 거지. 그 이게 동물들도 본인들이 이게 환경이 봐왔던 것 이거 아니면은 키우기가 쉽지 않은가 봐. 이게 적응력이 좀 필요한 것 같아. 야 그런 것 솔직히 그게 애완동물이라는 게 키우기가 쉽지가 않더라고. 나 최근에 회사 다닐 때 거기 그 실장님이 그 검은색 강아지야 푸들 종류인데 이름은 탄이라고 그놈이 인제 이렇게 있었어. 근데 나 입사해 가지고 좀 다니다 보니까 이제 고놈한테 자꾸 내 정을 안 주려고 그러다가 자꾸 눈에 보이니까 인제 자꾸 인제 정을 주기 시작한 거야. 그러니까 다른 사람들도 다 좋아하는데 특히 또 나를 또 잘 따르네 그래가지고 내가 얘를 점심시간에 인제 밥 먹고 나면 얘를 데리고 산책도 시켜 주고 그러면서 똥도 치워 주고 막 이랬었거든. 그 나중에 퇴사할 때 아 얘 때문에 마음이 너무 아픈 거야 이게 사람이. 그러니까 이게 정이 이게 주는 것도 물론 고놈아도 인제 나한테 정을 느꼈었겠지만 그게 쉽지가 않은 것 같아. 그래서 지금도 아잇 이거 강아지나 뭐 특히 강아지 키우고 싶은데 또 이게 정을 주면 내가 거기에 또 얽매여 있어야 되잖아 그럼 다른 생활을 할 수가 없어요 이 보니까 그 실장도 그러는 거야. 김 팀장 웬만하면 강아지 키우지 말라고 왜 그러냐면 자기 생활이 없는 거야. 아니 얘를 놔두고 어딜 이게 여행도 못 가고 그런다 해서 애견 센터에 갔다 올 수도 없잖아. 그런 또 사고도 많고 아 그런 경우가 많더라고. 아 그거 관련돼서 아 전에 알던 분인데 지인인데 그 얘를 한 15년인가 10년 정도 키웠대. 근데 그 죽어가지고 인제 그거를 옛날 같으면 어떻게 했겠어 그냥 뭐 이렇게 버리거나 대충 이렇게 야산에 그냥 묻고 그랬잖아. 지금은 그 강아지 애견 관련돼서 장례 문화도 또 이거 있어. 그거 화장시키는 데 돈이 얼마인지 알아? 거의 한 30에서 비싼 데는 한 돈 100만 원씩 들어가고 한대. 근데 가족들이 또 간대. 근데 거기 딸이 그렇게 많이 울더래. 그래서 그 아빠가 그랬대 우리 아는 지인이. 아빠 죽어도 그렇게 많이 울거냐 그랬대. 그것처럼 이게 나와서부터 걔들도 똑같은 거야. 가족으로 생각하는 거지. 어 그러다 보니까 정도 쌓이고 사랑을 줬으니까 그래서 보낼 때도 쉽게 못 보낸대. 결국은 인제 어 그렇게 된 거 같더라고. 어려워 어떻게 키우기가 쉽진 않아. 아유 그 당연히 싫지. 나도 나도 인제 거기 탄 고놈아를 데리고 이렇게 점심시간에 다니다 보면 너도 나도 할 것 없이 나이 드신 것이나 뭐 나이 적거나 다 그 강아지 하나씩 들고 다녀. 근데 목줄도 원래 이 2미터인가 그렇게 규정이 있어. 근데 목줄도 막 4미터 5미터씩 이러고 막 길게 하고 다니거든. 근데 조그만 개들이야 뭐 그렇다 치는데 좀 사나운 개들이 몇 개 한 있어. 뭐 그런 애들도 관리하기가 쉽지가 않잖아. 또 티브이 보면은 사고도 많이 나고 막 물림 사고도 있고 그다음에 막 이렇게 아무 데나 이렇게 오줌똥 싸 가지고 우리도 옛날에 많이 밟고 그랬잖아. 그것처럼 이렇게 관리하는 것은 그 본인이 그만큼 노력을 많이 해야 되는 것 같아. 그냥 쉬운 것은 아니고 게 뭐 나한테 만약에 누가 이렇게 애견을 준다 그러면 쉽게 마음은 가는데 이게 내가 그렇게 못 할 것 같으니까 그냥 포기하는 거지. 어 마음만 가는 거지. 아 근데 그것도 하나의 또 우리 마음은 그렇지 뭐든지. 근데 그 관리하는 측면에서 계속해 줄 수도 없는 상황도 있잖아. 그 그렇게 될 경우에는 우리 집사람 아침에 이렇게 출근한다고 태워다 주면 똑같은 거야. 그 이렇게 뚝방 위에다가 집을 한 5 6채를 이렇게 지어놓은 거야 조그맣게 이렇게 박스나 막 이런 거. 그럼 벌써 봐 미관상에도 안 좋잖아. 그다음에 고양이만 있는 게 아니고 고양이에 대한 그 사료를 주기 때문에 걔네들이 또 이 배변을 하고 뭐 이렇게 하다 보면 새들이 또 까마귀도 많이 날아들고 그러더라고 그런 거기에 인제 주차돼 보통 인제 길가에 주차를 많이 하잖아. 그 차 지붕 위에 똥들을 너무 많이 싸 놓은 거야 새들이. 왜 먹을 게 있으니까 그 고양이 그 사료를 먹을겠다고 그게 그런 또 환경 문제도 많이 생겨. 그러니까 보기에 미관상도 안 좋고 환경도 있고 또 불결하고 그 마음은 아 쟤들 먹잇거리 없어서 돌아다니면 챙겨주고 싶은데 또 다른 또 다른 쪽으로 봤을 때는 또 그런 문제가 많이 생기는 것 같더라고. 가급적이면은 신고해서 데리고 가는 게 제일 좋은 거 같아 내가 봤을 때. 그럼. 뭐 그건 뭐 그건 요즘에 들개라고 많이 생기잖아. 농작물도 많이 피해 주고 그냥 사람도 물어 가지고 또 그런 문제도 생기고 특히 우리 가축들 뭐 그 시골 같은 데 보면은 뭐 오리나 뭐 닭 이런 것도 물어서 많이 죽이고 또 광견병도 옮길 수도 있고 뭐 그런 경우도 많으니까 그 이 내가 봤을 때는 물론 이렇게 동물 단체에서도 물론 그런 관리를 하겠지만 중요한 게 정부에서 좀 어느 정도 관리를 좀 해줘야 될 필요성이 있다고 봐. 그거 사람이 일일이 해 줄 수는 없는 거잖아. 키워야지 본인이. 유기견이 있으면 예를 들어서 갖다 키우면 되는데 그 밖에다가 내놓은 상태에서 그냥 먹이만 준다는 것은 그건 관리가 아니거든. 그냥 그냥 내 동정하듯이 그냥 먹이만 주는 거지. 만약에 본인이 직접 그 진정 그 가축을 키운다고 그러면 데리고 와서 자기가 보살펴야 돼. 근데 밖에서 이렇게 마음을 쪼금 준다는 것은 그건 아니라고 봐 어떻게
